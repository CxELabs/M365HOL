# Tips and Tricks
[🔙](#introduction)

There are a few extras throughout this lab that are designed to make your lab experience a smooth and simple process.  Below are some icons you should watch out for that will save you time during each task.

## Interactive Elements

- Each task contains a series of steps required for successful completion of the lab.  To track your progress throughout the lab, check the box to the left of the numbered series.  

	![6mfi1ekm.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/6mfi1ekm.jpg)
- After you check each box, you will see your lab progress at the bottom of the instruction pane.

	![0ggu265u.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/0ggu265u.jpg)
- When you see an instruction for switching computers, click on the **blue link** in the text to have that VM loaded automatically.

	![12i85vgl.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/12i85vgl.jpg)
- Throughout the lab, you will see text with a letter **T** in a square to the left.  This indicates that you can **click on the text** and it will **type it for you** in the VM.  **This will save you lots of time**.

	![cnyu1tdi.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/cnyu1tdi.jpg)

- The last interactive element you will see throughout the lab is the **Open Screenshot** text below many steps.  To reduce clutter, most screenshots have been configured to launch in a popup window.  The only ones left visible are ones that could cause issues if they are missed or if there are multiple elements that are easier to understand with visual representation.

	![n4cqn070.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/n4cqn070.jpg)

## Additional Information

There are also Knowledge Items, Notes, and Hints throughout the lab.

- Knowledge Items are used to provide additional information about a topic related to the task or step.  These are often collapsed to reduce the amount of space they use, but it is recommended that you review these items if you want more information on the subject.

	![8g9nif1j.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/8g9nif1j.jpg)
- Notes are steps that do not require action or modification of any elements.  This includes general observations and reviewing the results of previous steps.

	![kxrbzsr2.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/kxrbzsr2.jpg)
- Hints are recommendations or observations that help with the completion of a step.

# Microsoft 365 Cloud App Security
[🔙](#introduction)

This lab will guide you through some of the Microsoft Cloud App Security
(MCAS) capabilities.

We expect you to already have experience with MCAS deployment and
configuration. In the different sections, you will be asked to fulfill
some tasks for which you will receive the requirements but not a step by
step guide to accomplish this task. A lab answer key document can be
provided to those needing it.

Most treat detections capabilities rely on auditing being enabled in your environment.By default, auditing is not enabled in Office 365 and must be turned on using the **Security & Compliance** admin console. In addition, some applications like Exchange Online require extra configuration, like enabling auditing per mailbox ([https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/enable-mailbox-auditing?redirectSourcePath=%252fen-us%252farticle%252fenable-mailbox-auditing-in-office-365-aaca8987-5b62-458b-9882-c28476a66918](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/enable-mailbox-auditing?redirectSourcePath=%252fen-us%252farticle%252fenable-mailbox-auditing-in-office-365-aaca8987-5b62-458b-9882-c28476a66918)).

As this operation can take up to 24h, your instructor will provide you access to another environment to review the alerts.

# Cloud Discovery
[🔙](#microsoft-365-cloud-app-security)

### Estimated time to complete
30 min

Continuous reports in Cloud Discovery analyze all logs that are
forwarded from your network using Cloud App Security. They provide
improved visibility over all data, and automatically identify anomalous
use using either the Machine Learning anomaly detection engine or by
using custom policies that you define.
To use this capability, you will perform in this lab the configuration
and troubleshooting of the Cloud Discovery feature.

> NOTE: The Docker engine has been pre-installed on LinuxVM using the commands at [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/discovery-docker-ubuntu](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/discovery-docker-ubuntu)

## How to troubleshoot the Docker log collector
[🔙](#microsoft-365-cloud-app-security)

In this task, you will review possible troubleshooting steps to identify
issues in automatic logs upload from the log collector.

There are several things to test at different locations: in the log
collector, in MCAS, at the network level.

### Useful commands
	
- To navigate in the directories, use the "cd" command.
	Examples: 

	**cd /var/adallom** to go to the specified directory

	**cd /** to go to the root directory

	**cd ..** to go to the parent directory
	
- To display the content of the logs, use the **more file_name** command
- To display the content of the directory, use the **ll** command
- To clear the screen, use the **clear** command

- For saving typing, use the **Tab** key and perform autocompletion.

### Verify the log collector (container) status

1. On Client01, open a session on PuTTY to **192.168.141.125** and use the credentials below.

	**user01**

	**Passw0rd1**

1. Run the following commands:

	```
	sudo -i
	```
	```
	docker stats
	```
	This command will show you the status of the log collector instance:

	![CONTAINER ID 2d7cadgfS4a1 13.14\* CPU 1.22\* MEM USAGE / LIMIT 187
	.1MiB / 1.39GiB NET I/o 10.gMB / 3 .23MB](vl5158cy.jpg)
1. Press **Ctrl-C** to end the command. 
1. Next, run the command below:

	```
	docker logs --details LogCollector
	```

	This command will show you the logs from the log collector to verify if
	it encountered errors when initiating:



	![rootaubuntu-srt: \'hame,\'seb 5 \--dzt.ei15 Setting ftp configuration

	Stayed up for](4bfomeag.jpg)

	 

#### To go further in the troubleshooting, you can connect to the log collector container to investigates the different logs.

1. Type the following command:

	```
	docker exec -it LogCollector bash
	```

1. You can then explore the container filesystem and inspect the
	**/var/adallom** directory. This directory is where you will investigate
	issues with the syslog or ftp logs being sent to the collector

	![ovjlyn26.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/ovjlyn26.jpg)

-   **/adallom/ftp/discovery**: this folder contains the data source
    folders where you send the log files for automated upload. This is
    also the default folder when logging into the collector with FTP
    credentials.

-   **/adallom/syslog/discovery**: if you setup the log collector to
    receive syslog messages, this is where the flat file of aggregated
    messages will reside until it is uploaded.

-   **/adallom/discoverylogsbackup**: this folder contains the last file
    that was sent to MCAS. This is useful for looking at the raw log in
    case there are parsing issues.

1. To validate that logs are correctly received from the network appliance,
you can also verify the **/var/log/pure-ftpd** directory and check the
transfer log:

	![erx39v7i.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/erx39v7i.jpg)

1. Now, move to the **/var/log/adallom** directory.

	![0h029uih.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/0h029uih.jpg)

-   **/var/log/adallom/columbus**: this folder is where you will find
    log files useful for troubleshooting issues with the collector
    sending files. In the log-archive folder you can copy previous logs
    compressed as .tar.gz files off the collector to send to support.

-   **/var/log/adallom/columbusInstaller**: this is where you will
    investigate issues with the collector itself. You will find here
    logs related to the configuration and bootstrapping of the
    collector. For example, trace.log will show you the bootstrapping
    process:

    ![ks4ttuuq.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/ks4ttuuq.jpg)

 


### Verify the connectivity between the log collector and MCAS

An easy way to test this is to download a sample of your appliance logs
from MCAS and use WinSCP to connect to the log collector to upload that
log and see if it gets uploaded to MCAS.

 

1. Upload the logs in the folder named by your source:

![bqhxmpns.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/bqhxmpns.jpg)

 

1. Then, check in MCAS the status:

	![21pseval.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/21pseval.jpg)

 

	![mt0o095m.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/mt0o095m.jpg)

 

	> NOTE: If the log stays in the source folder, then you know you probably have a
connection issue between the log collector and MCAS.

Another way to validate the connection is to log into the container like
in the previous task and then run *netstat -a* to check if we see
connections to MCAS:

1. In the PuTTY window, type the command below:

	```
	netstat -a
	```

# Threat Detection
[🔙](#microsoft-365-cloud-app-security)

### Estimated time to complete
20 min

Cloud App Security provides several [threats detection
policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/anomaly-detection-policy)
using machine learning and **user behavior analytics** to detect
suspicious activities across your different applications. After an
initial learning period, Cloud App Security will start alerting you when
suspicious actions like activity from anonymous IP addresses, infrequent
country, suspicious IP addresses, impossible travel, ransomware
activity, suspicious inbox forwarding configuration or unusual file
download are detected.

In addition to those policies, you can create your own policies, like
the ones on the next page, that you must create for this lab.
---
## Policies
[🔙](#microsoft-365-cloud-app-security)

### Exchange Online -- monitor mail forwarding configuration

This policy allows you to monitor admin and users mail forwarding
configuration. This policy is covering extra scenarios than the built-in
one.

**Activities to monitor:**

  |App               |Activity category              |Activity
  |----------------- |------------------------------ |---------------
  |Exchange Online   |Create forwarding inbox rule   |New-InboxRule
  |Exchange Online   |Edit mailbox forwarding        |Set-Mailbox
  |Exchange Online   |Edit forwarding inbox rule     |Set-InboxRule

As creating this kind of rules is part of the daily operations in a
company, we could recommend scoping the monitoring to **sensitive
groups** of users to monitor but this is not required for this lab.

![deg5ncg3.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/deg5ncg3.jpg)

### Exchange Online - add user to Exchange administrator role

This policy monitors when a user is added to an Exchange management role
group.

Although this action is usually legit, providing visibility on it is
usually required by security teams.

**Activities to monitor:**
  |App               |Activity category             |Activity
  |----------------- |---- 							|---------------------
  |Exchange Online   |N/A   						|Add-RoleGroupMember

Optionally, you could add as a condition "if IP address category is not
in Corporate".

![ao3du4ms.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/ao3du4ms.jpg)

### Exchange Online - Add management role assignment

This rule monitors possible management role assignments to a management
group.

For example, when someone is adding impersonation capabilities to a
group used to migrate mailboxes to Office 365.

Details about Exchange permissions and roles can be found [at this

### Exchange Online - New delegated access to sensitive mailbox

This policy monitors when a delegate is added to sensitive mailboxes,
like your CEO or HR team mailboxes or sensitive shared mailboxes.

We monitor two kinds of delegation: at the mailbox level, when an admin
performs the action, and at the client level, when delegation for
folders are added.

**Note**: Exchange logs can take some time before being available,
leading to some delay before the detection.

**Activities to monitor:**

We recommend scoping this policy to specific users only, to avoid too
many alerts, but this is not required for this lab.

  |App               |Activity category                   |Activity
  |----------------- |----------------------------------- |---------------------
  |Exchange Online   |Add mailbox folder permission   	  |Add-MailboxFolderPermission
  |Exchange Online   |Add permission to mailbox       	  |Add-MailboxPermission

### OneDrive -- Ownership granted to another user

This policy helps you to detect when someone is granted full access to
somebody OneDrive for Business site.

**Activities to monitor:**

  |App               |Activity category                   |Activity
  |----------------- |----------------------------------- |---------------------
  |OneDrive   		 |Add site collection administrator   |SiteCollectionAdminAdded

![rb4fqb83.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/rb4fqb83.jpg)

### 3rd party apps delegations

This policy helps you to detect new external apps for which users are
granting access to the select app (Office 365, G Suite, ...).

Detecting those delegations will help in the case of cloud ransomware,
or possible data exfiltration.

**Activities to monitor:**

We will monitor when an uncommon app is granted medium or high
permission level:

![mszki5q9.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/mszki5q9.jpg)

### Investigation in MCAS

Now that we have created those policies, we are going to investigate on
the alerts.

As your environments auditing might not be configured yet and will take
up to 24h before being enabled, those investigations will be performed
in the environment provided by your instructor.

Review the alerts in the environment and investigate to identify the
users and the malicious activities performed.

# Management
[🔙](#microsoft-365-cloud-app-security)

### Estimated time to complete
30 min

### Manage admin access 

For this task, you are asked to delegate admin access to other users,
without adding them to the Global Admin management role.

Documentation:
[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/manage-admins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/manage-admins)

#### Delegate user group administration

You are asked to delegate the management of MCAS for US employees to a
new administrator.

By following the explanations in the documentation you have to:

1.  Create a new administrator account "mcasAdminUS"

2.   Create a new Azure AD group "US employees" containing a couple of
    your test users (not your admin account)

3.   Delegate that group management in MCAS to "mcasAdminUS"

4.   Connect to MCAS with "mcasAdminUS" and compare the activities,
    alerts and actions that this admin can perform

#### Delegate MCAS administration to an external admin

As a Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs), you are asked by your
customer how you could access their environment to manage their alerts
in the Cloud App Security portal.

As the MCAS admin for your company, work with the person next to you to
configure an external access for the Managed Security Service Provider.

### MCAS PowerShell module introduction

To help administrators interact with MCAS in a programmatic way, two
Microsoft employees created a non-official PowerShell module for Cloud
App Security. For this lab, you will install this module and discover
the available cmdlets.

Note: the module relies on the Cloud App Security API. You can find its
documentation in the MCAS portal.

![f847xhzx.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/f847xhzx.jpg)

The module is available in the PowerShell gallery and can be installed
using the *Install-Module mcas* command.

![6j16dgs2.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/6j16dgs2.jpg)

More information on the module is available on GitHub:
[https://github.com/powershellshock/MCAS-Powershell](https://github.com/powershellshock/MCAS-Powershell)

After installing the module, read how to connect to MCAS in the
PowerShell help and start exploring the cmdlets.

Hint: you'll have to create an API token in Cloud App Security.

![0x2tzeqd.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/0x2tzeqd.jpg)

Using PowerShell:

1.  Review the list of MCAS administrators and when they were granted
    those permissions

2.   Review your security alerts and close them in bulk

3.   Download a sample SQUID log and send it to MCAS as a snapshot
    report.

4.   In the portal, in Discovery, tag some apps as unsanctioned and
    generate a blocking script for your appliance to block access to
    those apps.

5.   You are asked to define corporate IP's in MCAS. Subnets go from
    10.50.50.0/24 to 10.50.80.0/24

# Information protection
[🔙](#microsoft-365-cloud-app-security)

15 min

In a perfect world, all your employees understand the importance of information protection and work within your policies. But in a real world, it's probable that a partner who works with accounting uploads a document to your Box repository with the wrong permissions, and a week later you realize that your enterprise's confidential information was leaked to your competition.
Microsoft Cloud App Security helps you prevent this kind of disaster before it happens.

In this task, you will protect a sensitive document library in SharePoint Online using the native integration with Azure Information Protection.

## Integrate MCAS with Azure Information Protection

As explained in the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/azip-integration), configure the integration between the two solutions. 

1. Go to Cloud App Security settings and check the **Automatically scan new files** checkbox.

	![imku224m.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/imku224m.jpg)
2.  Click on the **Save** button.

3.  Go to **Policies**.

	![i2nnuzsg.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/i2nnuzsg.jpg)
4.  Create a new **File policy**.

	![aoodi6ml.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/aoodi6ml.jpg)
5.  Provide the following settings to that policy:
	1. Policy name: **Protect SSN documents in sensitive site**.
	1. Files matching all of the following: **remove the filters**.
	1. Apply to: **selected folder**.

	> NOTE: Here, select the **Shared Documents** folder from the default SharePoint site.

# Quarantine sensitive PDF for review
[🔙](#microsoft-365-cloud-app-security)

File policies are a great tool for finding threats to your information protection policies, for instance finding places where users stored sensitive information, credit card numbers and third-party ICAP files in your cloud. With Microsoft Cloud App Security, not only can you detect these unwanted files stored in your cloud that leave you vulnerable, but you can take immediate action to stop them in their tracks and lock down the files that pose a threat. Using Admin quarantine, you can protect your files in the cloud and remediate problems, as well as prevent future leaks from occurring.
This is what we are going to configure in this lab.

1. In Cloud App Security, go to the **Settings**.

	![oqfkh5cw.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/oqfkh5cw.jpg)
2.  In the Information Protection section, go to **Admin quarantine**.

	![pvjk90y0.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/pvjk90y0.jpg)
3.  In the dropdown menu, select your root SharePoint site.

	1. In user notification, type **Your content has been quarantined. Please contact your admin.**
	1. Click on the Save button.

    >NOTE: As best practice, you should define a dedicated site with restricted access as the admin quarantine location.

	![hl55gqvd.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/hl55gqvd.jpg)
4.  Next, go to the policies menu and create a new **file policy**.

	![3xpu3nw7.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/3xpu3nw7.jpg)
5.  Provide the following settings to that policy:
	1. Policy name: **Quarantine sensitive pdf**
	1. Files matching all of the following: **Extension equals pdf**
	
	![2cmlwt55.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/2cmlwt55.jpg)
	1. In Governance actions, select **Put in admin quarantine** and click on the Create button.
	
	![1wlrz08d.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/1wlrz08d.jpg)
 
## Test our policies

To test our files policies, perform the following tasks:

1. On Client01, unzip the content of the **Demo files.zip**.
7.  Go to the **Contoso Team Site** documents library.
8.  Upload the unzipped files to the site.


	![xf5ozmrf.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/xf5ozmrf.jpg)
9.  Cloud App Security will now scan those documents and search for matches to our created policies. The scan can take some minutes before completion.
10.  To monitor the evolution, go back to Cloud App Security and open the **Files** page of the investigations.

# Exercise 1: Configuring AIP Scanner for Discovery
[🔙](#azure-information-protection)

Even before configuring an AIP classification taxonomy, customers can scan and identify files containing sensitive information based on the built-in sensitive information types included in the Microsoft Classification Engine.  

![ahwj80dw.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/ahwj80dw.jpg)

Often, this can help drive an appropriate level of urgency and attention to the risk customers face if they delay rolling out AIP classification and protection.  

In this exercise, we will install the AIP scanner and run it against repositories in discovery mode.  Later in this lab (after configuring labels and conditions) we will revisit the scanner to perform automated classification, labeling, and protection of sensitive documents.

# Creating Azure AD Applications for the AIP Scanner
[🔙](#azure-information-protection)

Now that you have installed the scanner bits, you need to get an Azure AD token for the scanner service account to authenticate so that it can run unattended. This requires registering both a Web app and a Native app in Azure Active Directory.  The commands below will do this in an automated fashion rather than needing to go into the Azure portal directly.

1. In PowerShell, run **Connect-AzureAD** and use the username and password below. 
	
	**Global Admin Username**
	
	**Global Admin Password**
1. Next, **type the commands below** and press **Enter** to create a new Web App Registration and Service Principal in Azure AD.

   ```
   New-AzureADApplication -DisplayName AIPOnBehalfOf -ReplyUrls http://localhost
   $WebApp = Get-AzureADApplication -Filter "DisplayName eq 'AIPOnBehalfOf'"
   New-AzureADServicePrincipal -AppId $WebApp.AppId
   $WebAppKey = New-Guid
   $Date = Get-Date
   New-AzureADApplicationPasswordCredential -ObjectId $WebApp.ObjectID -startDate $Date -endDate $Date.AddYears(1) -Value $WebAppKey.Guid -CustomKeyIdentifier "AIPClient"
	```
1. Next, we must build the permissions object for the Native App Registration.  This is done using the commands below.
   
   ```
   $AIPServicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -All $true | ? {$_.DisplayName -eq 'AIPOnBehalfOf'}
   $AIPPermissions = $AIPServicePrincipal | select -expand Oauth2Permissions
   $Scope = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.ResourceAccess" -ArgumentList $AIPPermissions.Id,"Scope"
   $Access = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.RequiredResourceAccess"
   $Access.ResourceAppId = $WebApp.AppId
   $Access.ResourceAccess = $Scope
	```
1. Next, we will use the object created above to create the Native App Registration.
   
   ```
   New-AzureADApplication -DisplayName AIPClient -ReplyURLs http://localhost -RequiredResourceAccess $Access -PublicClient $true
   $NativeApp = Get-AzureADApplication -Filter "DisplayName eq 'AIPClient'"
   New-AzureADServicePrincipal -AppId $NativeApp.AppId
	```
   
1. Finally, we will output the Set-AIPAuthentication command by running the commands below.
   
   ```
   "Set-AIPAuthentication -WebAppID " + $WebApp.AppId + " -WebAppKey " + $WebAppKey.Guid + " -NativeAppID " + $NativeApp.AppId | Out-File ~\Desktop\Set-AIPAuthentication.txt
	Start ~\Desktop\Set-AIPAuthentication.txt
	```
1. Copy the command to the clipboard.
1. Click on the Start menu and type **PowerShell**, right-click on the PowerShell program, and click **Run as a different user**.

	![zgt5ikxl.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/zgt5ikxl.jpg)

1. When prompted, enter the username and password below and click **OK**.

	**Contoso\AIPScanner** 

	**Somepass1**

1. Paste the copied **Set-AIPAuthentication** command into this window and run it.
1. When prompted, enter the username and password below:

# Configuring Repositories
[🔙](#azure-information-protection)

In this task, we will configure repositories to be scanned by the AIP scanner.  As previously mentioned, these can be any type of CIFS file shares including NAS devices sharing over the CIFS protocol.  Additionally, On premises SharePoint 2010, 2013, and 2016 document libraries and lists (attachements) can be scanned.  You can even scan entire SharePoint sites by providing the root URL of the site.  There are several optional 

> NOTE: SharePoint 2010 is only supported for customers who have extended support for that version of SharePoint.

The next task is to configure repositories to scan.  These can be on-premises SharePoint 2010, 2013, or 2016 document libraries and any accessible CIFS based share.

1. In the PowerShell window on Scanner01 run the commands below

    ```
    Add-AIPScannerRepository -Path http://Scanner01/documents -SetDefaultLabel Off
	```
	```
	Add-AIPScannerRepository -Path \\Scanner01\documents -SetDefaultLabel Off
    ```
	>[!Knowledge] Notice that we added the **-SetDefaultLabel Off** switch to each of these repositories.  This is necessary because our Global policy has a Default label of **General**.  If we did not add this switch, any file that did not match a condition would be labeled as General when we do the enforced scan.

	![Open Screenshot](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/00niixfd.jpg)
1. To verify the repositories configured, run the command below.
	
    ```
    Get-AIPScannerRepository
    ```

# Running Sensitive Data Discovery
[🔙](#azure-information-protection)

1. Run the commands below to run a discovery cycle.

    ```
	Set-AIPScannerConfiguration -DiscoverInformationTypes All -Enforce Off
	```
	```
	Start-AIPScan
    ```

	>INFO: Note that we used the DiscoverInformationTypes -All switch before starting the scan.  This causes the scanner to use any custom conditions that you have specified for labels in the Azure Information Protection policy, and the list of information types that are available to specify for labels in the Azure Information Protection policy.  Although the scanner will discover documents to classify, it will not do so because the default configuration for the scanner is Discover only mode.
 	
1. Right-click on the **Windows** button in the lower left-hand corner and click on **Event Viewer**.
 
	![Open Screenshot](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/cjvmhaf0.jpg)

	>![agnx2gws.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/agnx2gws.jpg)
 
1. Next, switch to Client01, open a **File Explorer** window, and browse to **\\\Scanner01\c$\users\aipscanner\AppData\Local\Microsoft\MSIP\Scanner\Reports** and log on using the credentials below:

	**Contoso\LabUser**

	**Pa$$w0rd**

1. Review the summary txt and detailed csv files available there.  

	>NOTE: Since there are no Automatic conditions configured yet, the scanner found no matches for the 141 files scanned despite 136 of them having sensitive data.
	>
	>![aukjn7zr.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/aukjn7zr.jpg)

# Exercise 2: Configuring Azure Information Protection Policy
[🔙](#azure-information-protection)

This exercise demonstrates using the Azure Information Protection blade in the Azure portal to configure policies and sub-labels.  We will create a new sub-label and configure protection and then modify an existing sub-label.  We will also create a label that will be scoped to a specific group.  

Next, we will configure AIP Global Policy to use the General sub-label as default, and finally, we will configure a scoped policy to use the new scoped label by default for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint while still using General as default for Outlook.
---
# Creating, Configuring, and Modifying Sub-Labels
[🔙](#azure-information-protection)

In this task, we will configure a label protected for internal audiences that can be used to help secure sensitive data within your company.  By limiting the audience of a specific label to only internal employees, you can dramatically reduce the risk of unintentional disclosure of sensitive data and help reduce the risk of successful data exfiltration by bad actors.  

However, there are times when external collaboration is required, so we will configure a label to match the name and functionality of the Do Not Forward button in Outlook.  This will allow users to more securely share sensitive information outside the company to any recipient.  By using the name Do Not Forward, the functionality will also be familiar to what previous users of AD RMS or Azure RMS may have used in the past.

1. In the Azure Information Protection blade, under **classifications** in the left pane, click on **Labels** to load the Azure Information Protection – Labels blade.

# Configuring Advanced Policy Settings
[🔙](#azure-information-protection)

There are many advanced policy settings that are useful to tailor your Azure Information Protection deployment to the needs of your environment.  In this task, we will cover one of the settings that is very complimentary when using scoped policies that have no default label or a protected default label.  Because the No Default Label Scoped Policy we created in the previous task uses a protected default label, we will be adding an alternate default label for Outlook to provide a more palatable user experience for those users.

1. In the Azure Information Protection blade, under **classifications** on the left, click on **Labels** and then click on the **General** label.

# Defining Recommended and Automatic Conditions
[🔙](#azure-information-protection)

One of the most powerful features of Azure Information Protection is the ability to guide your users in making sound decisions around safeguarding sensitive data.  This can be achieved in many ways through user education or reactive events such as blocking emails containing sensitive data. 

However, helping your users to properly classify and protect sensitive data at the time of creation is a more organic user experience that will achieve better results long term.  In this task, we will define some basic recommended and automatic conditions that will trigger based on certain types of sensitive data.

1. Under **classifications** on the left, click **Labels** then expand **Confidential**, and click on **Contoso Internal**.

	![Open Screenshot](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/jyw5vrit.jpg)

# Exercise 3: Client Configuration
[🔙](#azure-information-protection)

Now that we have defined some basic AIP Policies, we need to configure some clients to demonstrate the Discovery, Classification, and Protection capabilities of Azure Information Protection.  In this exercise, we will configure Office 365 Applications for 3 test users to demonstrate these policy actions.  

Office 365 and the latest GA AIP Client (1.37.19.0) have already been installed on these systems to save time in this lab.  In your production environment, you will need to install the AIP Client manually for testing or using an Enterprise Deployment Tool like System Center Configuration Manager for widespread deployment.

We will also be disabling a mail flow rule in the Exchange Admin Center to allow mail to be sent outside the tenant.  This will allow us to test Do Not Forward and Office 365 Message Encryption scenarios.
---
# Configuring Applications
[🔙](#azure-information-protection)
 
In this task, we will configure Word and Outlook for 3 test users.  These users are Alan Steiner (Alan) and Amy Alberts (Amy) who we have defined as members of the Legal group, and Eric Grimes (Eric).  

This will allow us to demonstrate the differences between the global and scoped policy and demonstrate some of the protection features of Azure Information Protection in the next exercise.

# Exercise 4: Testing AIP Policies
[🔙](#azure-information-protection)

Now that you have 3 test systems with users being affected by different policies configured, we can start testing these policies.  This exercise will run through various scenarios to demonstrate the use of AIP global and scoped policies and show the functionality of recommended and automatic labeling.
---
# Testing User Defined Permissions
[🔙](#azure-information-protection)

One of the most common use cases for AIP is the ability to send emails using User Defined Permissions (Do Not Forward). In this task, we will send an email using the Do Not Forward label to test that functionality.


1. On Client03, in Microsoft Outlook, click on the **New email** button.

	![6wan9me1.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/6wan9me1.jpg)

	>INFO: Note that the **Sensitivity** is set to **General** by default.
	>
	> ![5esnhwkw.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/5esnhwkw.jpg)

1. Send an email to **Alan** and **Amy** (**Alan;Amy**). You may **optionally add an external email address** (preferably from a major social provider like gmail, yahoo, or outlook.com) to test the external recipient experience. For the **Subject** and **Body** type **Test Do Not Forward Email**.

	![Open Screenshot](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/h0eh40nk.jpg)

1. In the Sensitivity Toolbar, click on the **pencil** icon to change the Sensitivity label.

1. Switch over to Client01 or Client02 and review the email in Alan or Amy’s Outlook.  You will notice that the email is automatically shown in Outlook natively.

	![0xby56qt.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/0xby56qt.jpg)

	> NOTE: The **Do Not Forward** protection template will normally prevent the sharing of the screen and taking screenshots when protected documents or emails are loaded.  However, since this screenshot was taken within a VM, the operating system was unaware of the protected content and could not prevent the capture.  
	>
	>It is important to understand that although we put controls in place to reduce risk, if a user has view access to a document or email they can take a picture with their smartphone or even retype the message. That said, if the user is not authorized to read the message then it will not even render and we will demonstrate that next.

	>INFO: If you elected to send a Do Not Forward message to an external email, you will have an experience similar to the images below.  These captures are included to demonstrate the functionality for those that chose not to send an external message.

	![bxz190x2.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/bxz190x2.jpg)
	
1. In your email, note that you will be unable to open this message.  This experience will vary depending on the client you use (the image below is from Outlook 2016 for Mac) but they should have similar messages after presenting credentials. Since this is not the best experience for the recipient, later in the lab we will configure Exchange Online Mail Flow Rules to prevent content classified with internal only labels from being sent to external users.

# Testing Scoped Policy
[🔙](#azure-information-protection)

In this task, we will create a document and send an email from one of the users in the Legal group to demonstrate the functionality defined in the first exercise. We will also show the behavior of the No Default Label policy on documents.

1. Switch to Client01.
1. In Microsoft Outlook, click on the **New email** button.
	
	![Open Screenshot](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/ldjugk24.jpg)

	>
	>![htjesqwe.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/htjesqwe.jpg)

1. On Client01, open **Microsoft Word**.
1. Create a new **Blank document** and type **This is a test document** and **save the document**.

	> WARNING: When you click **Save**, you will be prompted to choose a classification.  This is a result of having **None** set as the default label in the scoped policy while requiring all documents to be labeled.  This is a useful for driving **active classification decisions** by specific groups within your organization.  Notice that Outlook still has a default of **General** because of the Advanced setting we added to the scoped policy.  **This is recommended** because user send many more emails each day than they create documents. Actively forcing users to classify each email would be an unpleasant user experience whereas they are typically more understanding of having to classify each document if they are in a sensitive department or role.

1. Choose a classification to save the document.

# Testing Recommended and Automatic Classification
[🔙](#azure-information-protection)

In this task, we will test the configured recommended and automatic conditions we defined in Exercise 1.  Recommended conditions can be used to help organically train your users to classify sensitive data appropriately and provides a method for testing the accuracy of your dectections prior to switching to automatic classification.  Automatic conditions should be used after thorough testing or with items you are certain need to be protected. Although the examples used here are fairly simple, in production these could be based on complex regex statements or only trigger when a specific quantity of sensitive data is present.

1. Switch to Client03 and launch **Microsoft Word**.
1. In Microsoft Word, create a new **Blank document** and type **My AMEX card number is 344047014854133. The expiration date is 09/28, and the CVV is 4368** and **save** the document.

	> NOTE: This card number is a fake number that was generated using the Credit Card Generator for Testing at [https://developer.paypal.com/developer/creditCardGenerator/](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/creditCardGenerator/).  The Microsoft Classification Engine uses the Luhn Algorithm to prevent false positives so when testing, please make sure to use valid numbers.

1. Notice that you are prompted with a recommendation to change the classification to Confidential \ Contoso Internal. Click on **Change now** to set the classification and protect the document.

	![url9875r.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/url9875r.jpg)

# Exercise 5: Exchange Online IRM Capabilities
[🔙](#azure-information-protection)

Exchange Online can work in conjunction with Azure Information Protection to provide advanced capabilities for protecting sensitive data being sent over email.  You can also manage the flow of classified content to ensure that it is not sent to unintended recipients.  

## Configuring Exchange Online Mail Flow Rules

In this task, we will configure a mail flow rule to detect sensitive information traversing the network in the clear and encrypt it using the Encrypt Only RMS Template.  We will also create a mail flow rule to prevent messages classified as Confidential \ Contoso Internal from being sent to external recipients.

1. Switch to Client01 and open an **Admin PowerShell Prompt**.

1. Type the commands below to connect to an Exchange Online PowerShell session.  Use the credentials provided when prompted.

	```
	Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
	```

	```
	$UserCredential = Get-Credential
	```

	**Global Admin Username**

	**Global Admin Password**

	```
	$Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $UserCredential -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection
	Import-PSSession $Session
	```

1. Create a new Exchange Online Mail Flow Rule using the code below:

	```

# Exercise 6: Classification, Labeling, and Protection with the Azure Information Protection Scanner
[🔙](#azure-information-protection)

The Azure Information Protection scanner allows you to  classify and protect sensitive information stored in on-premises CIFS file shares and SharePoint sites.  

In this exercise, you will use the information gathered in Exercise 1 to map sensitive data types discovered to automatic classification rules.  After that, we will run the AIP Scanner in enforce mode to classify and protect the identified sensitive data.

---

# Configuring Automatic Conditions
[🔙](#azure-information-protection)
 
Now that we know what types of sensitive data we need to protect, we will configure some automatic conditions (rules) that the scanner can use to classify and protect content.

1. Switch back to Client01 and open the browser that is logged into the Azure Portal.

1. Under **Dashboards** on the left, click on **Data discovery (Preview)** to view the data collected by the AIP scanner discovery mode run.

	>WARNING: Due to lab environment infrastructure constraints, it is possible that the data will not fully populate by the time you reach this point in the lab. Please continue through the steps using the provided information.  If you set this up in an external lab environment, these steps will work as described.

1. In the Information Types panel, you will see the types of sensitive data that was found during the initial discovery run. We will use a few of these to create Automatic Conditions.

	![x4w16p5g.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/x4w16p5g.jpg)

1. Under **Classifications** on the left, click **Labels** then expand **Confidential**, and click on **Contoso Internal**.

	![Open Screenshot](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/jyw5vrit.jpg)
1. In the Label: Contoso Internal blade, scroll down to the **Configure conditions for automatically applying this label** section, and click on **+ Add a new condition**.

	![cws1ptfd.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/cws1ptfd.jpg)
1. In the Condition blade, in the **Select information types** search box, type **International** and check the box next to the **International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10-CM)** entry.

	![Open Screenshot](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/j163rbh7.jpg)
1. Next, before saving, replace International in the search bar with **EU** and check the boxes next to the **items shown below**.

	![xaj5hupc.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/xaj5hupc.jpg)
1. Click **Save** in the Condition blade and **OK** to the Save settings prompt.

	![Open Screenshot](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/41o5ql2y.jpg)
1. In the Label : Contoso Internal blade, under **Select how this label is applied: automatically or recommended to user**, click **Automatic**.

	![Open Screenshot](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/1ifaer4l.jpg)

# Enforcing Configured Rules
[🔙](#azure-information-protection)
 
In this task, we will set the AIP scanner to enforce the conditions we set up in the previous task and have it rerun on all files using the Start-AIPScan command.

1. Switch to Scanner01
1. Run the commands below to run an enforced scan using defined policy.

    ```
	Set-AIPScannerConfiguration -Enforce On -DiscoverInformationTypes PolicyOnly
	```
	```
	Start-AIPScan
    ```

	> NOTE: Note that this time we used the DiscoverInformationTypes -PolicyOnly switch before starting the scan. This will have the scanner only evaluate the conditions we have explicitly defined in conditions.  This increases the effeciency of the scanner and thus is much faster.  After reviewing the event log we will see the result of the enforced scan.
	>
	>![k3rox8ew.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/k3rox8ew.jpg)
	>
	>If we switch back to Client03 and look in the reports directory we opened previously at **\\\Scanner01\c$\users\aipscanner\AppData\Local\Microsoft\MSIP\Scanner\Reports**, you will notice that the old scan reports are zipped in the directory and only the most recent results aare showing.  
	>
	>![s8mn092f.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/s8mn092f.jpg)

# Simulate risky sign-ins experience
[🔙](#azure-active-directory)

Let’s see what happens when users try to sign in from the Tor Browser, which anonymizes their IP and can be used by malicious actors.

1.	Log in to Client03 and launch Tor Browser
2. 	Navigate to **https://portal.office.com** and log-in with the credentials below:

	**Eric@yourtenant.com**

	**pass@word1**

	1.	Notice how they are not blocked because they are not targeted by the risky sign-ins policies
3. 	Now, open a new Tor window and log-in to **https://portal.office.com with the credentials below
		
		**Alan@yourtenant.com**

		**pass@word1**

	1.	Notice how you are prompted for MFA due to the risky sign-ins policy
4. 	To generate an additional risky sign-in, open a new Tor window and log-in to **https://portal.office.com++ with **Amy@yourtenant.com**
	1.	Notice how you are prompted for MFA due to the risky sign-ins policy

##What happens if a user is targeted by the risky sign-ins policy but has not yet registered for MFA?

1.	Open a new Tor window and log-in to **https://portal.office.com** with the credentials below:

	**Ben@yourtenant.com**

	**pass@word1**
	
	1.	Notice how you are blocked because the user has not registered for MFA yet and is thus unable to beat the MFA challenge prompted by the risky sign-ins policy
6. 	So that Ben can respond to future MFA attempts, open an Edge browser window and now navigate to portal.office.com and log-in as Ben
	1.	You will be prompted to register for MFA

# Pull data from APIs
[🔙](#azure-active-directory)

## Get Started with the API

There are four steps to accessing Identity Protection data through Microsoft Graph:


1.	Create a new app registration. 
3. 	Use this secret and a few other pieces of information to authenticate to Microsoft Graph, where you receive an authentication token. 
4. 	Use this token to make requests to the API endpoint and get Identity Protection data back.

## Create a new app registration

1.	On the Active Directory page, in the Manage section, click App registrations.

	![h5fd84va.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/h5fd84va.jpg)
2. 	In the menu on the top, click New application registration.
 
	![vptami21.jpg](https://github.com/CxELabs/M365HOL/blob/master/Media/vptami21.jpg)

## Authenticate to Microsoft Graph and query the Identity Risk Events API
[🔙](#azure-active-directory)

At this point, you should have specified the following values in your text file:

- The client ID 

- The key 

## Querying the API using PowerShell

Now that we have configured the app registration and retrieved the values needed to authenticate, we can query the IdentityRiskEvents API using PowerShell.

## See medium-risk and  high-risk events

First, let’s assess how many risk events we have that are medium or high risk. These are the events that have the capability to trigger the sign-in or user-risk policies. Since they have a medium or high likelihood of user compromise, remediating these events should be a priority. 

1. Open a **PowerShell ISE** window and, in the **script pane**, type the PowerShell code below.  

1. Insert the saved **Client ID** and **key** for the values of **ClientID** and **ClientSecret** variable and click **Run**.

	```
	##Get all your medium or high-risk risk events

	$ClientID       = "ClientID"        # Should be a ~36 hex character string; insert your info here
	$ClientSecret   = "ClientSecret"    # Should be a ~44 character string; insert your info here
	$tenantdomain   = "yourtenant.com"    # For example, contoso.onmicrosoft.com

	$loginURL       = "https://login.microsoft.com"
	$resource       = "https://graph.microsoft.com"
	$body      = @{grant_type="client_credentials";resource=$resource;client_id=$ClientID;client_secret=$ClientSecret}
	$oauth     = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $loginURL/$tenantdomain/oauth2/token?api-version=beta -Body $body
	Write-Output $oauth
	if ($oauth.access_token -ne $null) {
	$headerParams = @{'Authorization'="$($oauth.token_type) $($oauth.access_token)"}
	$url = "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identityRiskEvents $filter=riskLevel eq 'high' or riskLevel eq 'medium'" 
	Write-Output $url
	$myReport = (Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Headers $headerParams -Uri $url)
	foreach ($event in ($myReport.Content | ConvertFrom-Json).value) {
		Write-Output $event
	}
	} else {
	Write-Host "ERROR: No Access Token"
	} 
	```

## Investigate a specific user
When you believe a user may have been compromised, you can better understand the state of their risk by getting all of their risk events. Similarly, if you have users that you believe may be more likely targets of compromise, you can proactively retrieve their risky events.

Since we know that Alan had some risky-sign ins, let’s query their risk events.

1. In the **PowerShell ISE**, open a new file and, in the **script pane**, type the PowerShell code below.

1. Insert the saved **Client ID** and **key** for the values of **ClientID** and **ClientSecret** variable and click **Run**.

	```
	##Get a specific user's risk events

	$ClientID       = "ClientID"        # Should be a ~36 hex character string; insert your info here
	$ClientSecret   = "ClientSecret"    # Should be a ~44 character string; insert your info here
	$tenantdomain   = "yourtenant.com"    # For example, contoso.onmicrosoft.com

	$loginURL       = "https://login.microsoft.com"
	$resource       = "https://graph.microsoft.com"
	$body      = @{grant_type="client_credentials";resource=$resource;client_id=$ClientID;client_secret=$ClientSecret}
	$oauth     = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $loginURL/$tenantdomain/oauth2/token?api-version=beta -Body $body
	Write-Output $oauth
	if ($oauth.access_token -ne $null) {
	$headerParams = @{'Authorization'="$($oauth.token_type) $($oauth.access_token)"}
	$url = "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identityRiskEvents?`$filter=userID eq '<Alan’s user ID>'"
	Write-Output $url
	$myReport = (Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Headers $headerParams -Uri $url)
	foreach ($event in ($myReport.Content | ConvertFrom-Json).value) {
		Write-Output $event
	}
	} else {
	Write-Host "ERROR: No Access Token"
	} 
	```

# Simulate risky user experience
[🔙](#azure-active-directory)

Remember our risky sign-ins from earlier? Let’s take a look at them in the Azure portal

1.	Navigate to **https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_AAD_IAM_ipcv2=true&Microsoft_AAD_IAM_securityarea=true#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Security**
2. 	Click on the **Security** blade and then select **Risky sign-ins**
3. 	You should see the Tor sign ins from Alan, Ben, and Eric. To dive deeper, click on a specific sign-in record
4. 	In the details drawer, you can toggle through the basic info, device info, risk info tabs to learn more about that particular sign-in

Now that we have taken a look at risky sign-ins, let’s find out what happens if Identity Protection detects a high-risk user. For the purposes of this lab, we will force a user to go to **high-risk**

1.	Navigate to **https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_AAD_IAM_ipcv2=true&Microsoft_AAD_IAM_securityarea=true#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Security**
2. 	Click on the **Security** blade and then select **Risky sign-ins**
3. 	Click on the risky sign-in record for Ben and select **confirmed compromise**
4. 	Now, open a new InPrivate window and try to log-in to portal.office.com as Ben
	1.	You will be prompted to reset Ben’s password
